    "It wasn't possible--until now. Easily migrate between major versions of RHEL-based distributions from 7.x to 8.x. Preserve your applications, your data, and your sanity. Run the most recent version of the OS and software you need.": "",
    "Package Evolution Service": "",
    "The beating heart of ELevate is the <a href=\"%(pes_link)s\">Package Evolution Service</a> (PES) which allows you to download, customize and even submit new data sets for packages. Users and maintainers can both utilize the PES to help make migrations smooth and easy.": "",

    "FAQ": "",
    "What is ELevate?": "",
    "ELevate is a project aimed to provide the ability to migrate between major versions of RHEL-based distributions from 7.x to 8.x. It combines Red Hat's Leapp framework with a community created library and service for the migration metadata set required for it.": "",
    "This looks awesome. How can I contribute?": "",
    "First join us at <a href=\"%(chat_link)s\">#migration</a> Mattermost channel. You can find the tool code here: <a href=\"%(github_link)s\">%(github_link)s</a> and you can add/edit/interact with package metadata at <a href=\"%(pes_link)s\">%(pes_link)s</a>.": "",
    "Is this ready for production?": "",
    "YMMV.  Every environment is different and unique based on applications and configurations. Since this is still under development, to avoid any surprises, we highly recommend that you test migrations scenarios in a VM or sandbox before running a migration in production.": "",
    "What operating systems does ELevate support?": "",
    "Currently ELevate provides Leapp data for migration from CentOS 7 to the following OS: <ul> <li>AlmaLinux OS 8</li> <li>CentOS Stream 8</li> <li>Oracle Linux 8</li> <li>Rocky Linux 8</li> </ul>": "",
