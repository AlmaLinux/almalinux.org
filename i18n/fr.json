    "CloudLinux's core product, the CloudLinux OS, is a RHEL® fork that has been in place for over ten years. More than 4,000 companies including Dell, Liquid Web, and 1&1 rely on the CloudLinux OS across more than 200,000 product installations. CloudLinux has proven experience in creating and maintaining a RHEL fork and have done so starting with RHEL release 5, right through to release 8. AlmaLinux OS is an opportunity for us to channel our expertise in RHEL into a Linux distribution that serves the broader community. Furthermore, we are including the Linux community right from the inception of AlmaLinux OS. Moving forward, community members will be on the governing board for the AlmaLinux OS project and involved in key decisions too. Finally, AlmaLinux OS will always be free and open source. The community can pick up and continue to develop AlmaLinux OS at any time.": "",
