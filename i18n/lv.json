    "FAQ": "",
    "What is ELevate?": "",
    "ELevate is a project aimed to provide the ability to migrate between major versions of RHEL-based distributions from 7.x to 8.x. It combines Red Hat's Leapp framework with a community created library and service for the migration metadata set required for it.": "",

    "Is this ready for production?": "",
    "YMMV.  Every environment is different and unique based on applications and configurations. Since this is still under development, to avoid any surprises, we highly recommend that you test migrations scenarios in a VM or sandbox before running a migration in production.": "",

    "The Package Evolution Service stores package migration metadata. Metadata answers questions about how packages evolve between major distribution releases.
