    "FAQ": "",
    "What is ELevate?": "",
    "ELevate is a project aimed to provide the ability to migrate between major versions of RHEL-based distributions from 7.x to 8.x. It combines Red Hat's Leapp framework with a community created library and service for the migration metadata set required for it.": "",

    "Is this ready for production?": "",
    "YMMV.  Every environment is different and unique based on applications and configurations. Since this is still under development, to avoid any surprises, we highly recommend that you test migrations scenarios in a VM or sandbox before running a migration in production.": "",
    "What operating systems does ELevate support?": "",
    "Currently ELevate provides Leapp data for migration from CentOS 7 to the following OS: <ul> <li>AlmaLinux OS 8</li> <li>CentOS Stream 8</li> <li>Oracle Linux 8</li> <li>Rocky Linux 8</li> </ul>": "",
