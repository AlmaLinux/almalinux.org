            "the term “Software Bill of Materials” or “SBOM” means a formal
            record containing the details and supply chain relationships of
            various components used in building software. Software developers
            and vendors often create products by assembling existing open source
            and commercial software components. The SBOM enumerates these
            components in a product. It is analogous to a list of ingredients on
            food packaging."
