                            ELevate is a project aimed to provide the ability to migrate between major versions of
                            RHEL-based distributions from 7.x to 8.x. It combines Red Hat's Leapp framework with a
                            community created library and service for the migration metadata set required for it.

                            YMMV.  Every environment is different and unique based on applications and configurations.
                            Since this is still under development, to avoid any surprises, we highly recommend that you
                            test migrations scenarios in a VM or sandbox before running a migration in production.

                            The Package Evolution Service stores package migration metadata. Metadata answers questions
                            about how packages evolve between major distribution releases. PES supports several classes
                            of rules for packages such as added, removed, renamed, split, merged, and so on. The service
                            also allows everyone to improve the data by adding new actions or even create a custom
                            dataset for packages from third-party or private repositories.
