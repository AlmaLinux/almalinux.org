# Contributing

If you are interested in making a contribution there are a few ways you could help out the project.

## Filing issues

You are free to use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues) to submit bugs and for 
discussions related to the codebase.

### Reporting a Bug

Good bug reports can be very helpful. A bug is a demonstrable problem with the code or functionality.

Please use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues) and check if the issue has
already been reported.

A good bug report should be as detailed as possible, so that others won't have to follow up for the essential details.

- Submit a bug in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues)

### Requesting a Feature

1. [Search the issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues) for any previous requests for the same
   feature, and give a thumbs up or +1 on existing requests.
1. If no previous requests exist, create a new issue. Please be as clear as possible about why the feature is needed and
   the intended use case.

## Contributing code

If you plan to propose code changes it is required you create
an [issue](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues) with a brief proposal and discuss it with
us first.

This is necessary to avoid more than one contributor working on the same feature/change and to avoid someone from
spending time on feature/change that would not be merged for any reason.

For smaller contributions use this workflow:

* Create an [issue](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues) describing the changes.
* Await confirmation from contributors.
* Fork the project.
* Create a branch for your feature or bug fix.
* Add code changes, relevant documentation, etc.
* Send a pull request.

After one of the contributors has checked and approved the changes, they will be merged into master branch and will be
included in the next deployment.

## Approval of changes

Before any changes can be merged:

- All minor or cosmetic changes (typos, minor styling, etc) can be approved and merged by any contributor with master
  merge rights,
- All non-cosmetic changes to the website requires the approval of the Web Team lead and at least one other Web Team
  member.
- All major changes that are not purely technical, and fundamental changes in technology requires the approval of the
  AlmaLinux OS Community Manager.
