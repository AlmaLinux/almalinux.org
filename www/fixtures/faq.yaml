    question: Who is AlmaLinux OS for?
    answer: >
      Individuals and organizations that require an enterprise-grade, Fedora-like distribution but who
      do not want to or cannot pay for a RHEL&reg; license. AlmaLinux OS is also a perfect replacement
      for anyone who currently relies on the CentOS Linux stable release to achieve computing objectives.

    question: Why did we call it AlmaLinux OS?
    answer: >
      Alma means soul in Spanish and other Latin languages. Looking back, it is easy to see that Linux
      is as popular and pervasive as it is thanks to the efforts of a passionate, diverse developer
      community. This community is the soul of Linux, and everyone that relies on a Linux distribution
      is indebted to the efforts of the Linux community. That is why we called our new distribution
      AlmaLinux OS.

    question: What motivated the folks at CloudLinux to get started?
    answer: >
      We were already doing it! The folks who worked together early were already familiar with RHEL forks 
	  because they were building CloudLinux. Igor Seletskiy believed in the need for a stable, downstream RHEL
	  clone, had the staff, the capabilities, and the resources to get it done.

    question: I want to convert from CentOS to AlmaLinux OS. How do I do it?
    answer: >
      Switching Linux distros can be a headache, but that is not the case when switching from CentOS
      to AlmaLinux OS. Just like CentOS, AlmaLinux OS is a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL&reg;, so
      switching is simple. Take a look at the <a href="https://almalinux.org/elevate">ELevate tool</a> to see how simple migrations and even 
	  major version upgrades can be.

    question: Can I really port an entire fleet of servers from CentOS to AlmaLinux OS with a single command?
    answer: >
      Yes, AlmaLinux OS is a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL&reg;, which means that your
      applications and services will remain compatible. For that reason, you can rapidly migrate any
      number of servers with just one command.
