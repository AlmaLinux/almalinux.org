Just a quick note to let everyone know that cloud-init/generic cloud images are now available for the PPC64LE architecture as part of the ongoing beta.

The image is available from: https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8/cloud/ppc64le/images/ and you can of course find the relevant documentation on the wiki here: https://wiki.almalinux.org/cloud/Generic-cloud.html.
