1. The stable release of the AlmaLinux OS is just a couple of weeks away. The first stable release is a significant milestone for the Open Source community and the world at large. We intend to celebrate our team's achievement, the achievement of the community, and the achievement of the Open Source movement at large.In the last four months, we - the mind of AlmaLinux OS - did our part in preparing the infrastructure for a stable release. But we couldn’t possibly be here without you, the community--the soul of AlmaLinux OS. With your commitment to Beta and Release Candidate testing, it's now possible for us to deliver the release on the date we committed with the first Project Lenix announcement - Q1 2021. CloudLinux and the community are a great team! We appreciate the hard work of every member of this alliance!To commemorate a successful synergy of AlmaLinux OS’ “mind” and “soul” and cement the distribution's place in history, we want to create an inspiring video--featuring all of YOU--and all the members of the AlmaLinux OS team saying “We Are AlmaLinux”.Well, what kind of team doesn't have branded gear, right? **If you submit your video following the instructions below by the March 20th, you'll be entered to win one of 100 AlmaLinux branded T-shirts that we'll be raffling off.** Recording the video and sharing it will take 5 minutes tops. The instructions below are for using Zoom but you can use any other platform that can record videos with the background:Download one of our awesome AlmaLinux OS wallpapers from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/af9sda49m8nrctl/AACfFR3sBSOlbTfQjOIAiNPra?dl=0).
2. Go to Zoom and select the wallpaper as a Virtual Background.
3. Start a new conference as a host.
4. Switch on the recording.
5. Look at the camera and say, "We are AlmaLinux"
6. Finish the recording, save it, and share it on your Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok or LinkedIn. You must mention #WeAreAlmaLinux in your post so we can find your video and add it to our video ‘time capsule’ and add you to our t-shirt raffle.
7. Follow AlmaLinux OS on social media. We will contact you via SM channels if you win a t-shirt.

Here is an example of the video by the AlmaLinux OS Community Manager, Jack Aboutboul: [video width="1280" height="720" mp4="https://almalinux.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/zoom_1.mp4"][/video] We can’t wait to see each and every one of you, the soul of AlmaLinux OS.
