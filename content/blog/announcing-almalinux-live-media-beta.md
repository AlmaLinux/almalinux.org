Hi Community! We’ve got some great news. Announcing our AlmaLinux 8 Live Media beta.

Currently, the Beta is available in 2 variants:

- GNOME Mini: contains a core GNOME environment with the Firefox browser
- GNOME: contains a full GNOME environment with popular workstation applications like LibreOffice, Thunderbird and so on.

Also, stay tuned because KDE and XFCE Live Media images are coming soon.

Images support both BIOS and UEFI (including Secure Boot mode), can be written to DVD or USB media.
