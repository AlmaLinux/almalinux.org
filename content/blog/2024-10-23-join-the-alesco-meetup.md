Since our inception just a few months ago, there has been a lot of exciting news coming out of ALESCo. Whether you've been following along [via the minutes](https://wiki.almalinux.org/alesco.html), or attending the meetings yourself, or engaging in our chat, we are so humbled by the excitement around what we're doing.

Tomorrow, Oct 24th at [10am eastern US time](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&lid=4998830,2643743,8,1850147&h=2643743&hf=1), we're hosting a digital meetup. We'll be hanging out, ready to answer questions or just talk shop. Not all of our members will be abel to make it, but we'll have a good cross-section of the SIGs present, as well as our board chair.Â
