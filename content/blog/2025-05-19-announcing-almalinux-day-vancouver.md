We are excited to share that AlmaLinux Day: Vancouver will take place Saturday, August 9, 2025, at the Emily Carr University of Art + Design.

Like its predecessors, this community-powered, full-day event will bring together sysadmins, developers, DevOps engineers, IT leaders, and open-source enthusiasts for a packed day of technical talks, real-world case studies, and collaborative networking. With its proximity to SIGGRAPH, the event will place a special spotlight on how AlmaLinux is used in the VFX and post-production industries.

## Join us as a presenter!

For the first time, we are accepting submitted talks for this event! The call for speakers is now open, with proposals due by June 22, 2025. We are inviting submissions from anyone using AlmaLinux in production, contributing upstream, or exploring innovative ways to harness enterprise Linux in open-source environments. As benny Vasquez, chair of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation, puts it, the event aims to "build, learn, and grow the future of open-source infrastructure in the VFX industry." Submit your session ideas now at[  sessionize.com/almalinux-day-vancouver](http://sessionize.com/almalinux-day-vancouver).

## Sponsor or Volunteer at AlmaLinux Day: Vancouver!

This event is our fourth full-day event dedicated to AlmaLinux, and we are thrilled to be able to accept sponsors for this event. With an annual budget of under $300,000, the AlmaLinux OS Foundation relies heavily on the support of its community to put events like this together.

Our sponsorship packages range in price from $100 to $7500, but we'll tailor a package that works just for you!

Volunteers are needed both ahead of time and during the actual event! We're looking for folks to help with everything from design work (we need stickers and other fun stuff!) to staffing the check-in table, from setup and tear down to acting as code of conduct report reviewers.

If you're itching to get involved, email us at <aldv@almalinux.org> and we'll get you lined up!
