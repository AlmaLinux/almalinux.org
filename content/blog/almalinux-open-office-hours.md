Hello Community!

Please join us for Open Office Hours every Monday at 4pm UTC/12pm EDT/9am PDT on The [AlmaLinux Community Chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/) beginning Monday August 2nd, 2021.

Our community has been growing and questions keep rolling in every day. We'll have Core team members, members of our Cloud and Containers team, Packaging and Release Engineering and Community teams as well as [AlmaLinux Foundation Board members](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Transparency.html) available to answer your questions live in real-time. You can also email [officehours@almalinux.org](mailto:officehours@almalinux.org) if there is anything specific you would like to discuss and we'll bring it up during the session.

Join us for a chance to have your questions answered, your issues raised and to hang out with fellow community members.

FYI: We are still available almost any time of day The [AlmaLinux Community Chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/) and that won't change. The motivation for this is to hold a public forum at a certain time where anyone can have their questions answered and have team members be available. You can also continue to ask questions via the [Forums](https://forums.almalinux.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlmaLinux/) or [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/AlmaLinux).
