I'm proud to announce three more Silver Sponsor Members of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation! We're so grateful for the contributions of our every-growing list of sponsors, as more and more companies prove that they believe in what we do. Here's a little bit about each of the three newly announced members. 

## Codenotary

Codenotary (www.codenotary.com), as the leading company for secure software supply chain, brings trust and integrity into the software life cycle by providing end-to-end cryptographically verifiable tracking and provenance for all artifacts, actions and dependencies. Codenotary's solution allows customers to identify and track billions of artifacts within their IT organizations and make sure only trusted and known components are used. Based in Houston, Texas, Codenotary was founded in 2018.

Codenotary first joined the foundation as a Platinum Sponsor member in 2022, and has continued to back us as a Silver Sponsor member both with funding, and with the infrastructure that supports our SBOM endeavors. Their CEO, Moshe Bar, has been a big supporter and on our board from the beginning.

"Our software needs an operating system that is truly free and community-owned to give us peace of mind from any future royalty demands," said Moshe Bar, CEO  at Codenotary. "No other Red Hat-based distribution can give us this crucial guarantee. AlmaLInux is also industry-leading in addressing new vulnerabilities quickly."

## ATIX AG

ATIX (www.atix.de), as the leading Linux system house in the German-speaking region, offers IT services in the field of infrastructure with a focus on Linux in the data center, providing professional IT consulting, innovative engineering, and first-class technical support. With orcharhino, ATIX has a software solution for the orchestration of data centers. This tool can be used to automate deployment and configuration management as well as lifecycle and patch management. It offers a standardized interface for administration, both on-premises and in the cloud. The basic principles of ATIX's work are expertise, independence, professionalism and flexibility. Based in Garching, near Munich, Germany, ATIX was founded in 1995.

Like Codenotary, ATIX AG has been a sponsor member of the foundation since 2022. They also joined us for AlmaLinux Day: Germany to talk about how they were using AlmaLinux.

"We are proud to partner with AlmaLinux, as their platform provides an excellent basis for the operation of orcharhino," said Mark Hlawatschek, CIO & Founder of ATIX. "This collaboration ensures that orcharhino is ideally equipped to manage AlmaLinux systems efficiently."

## StorPool Storage AD

StorPool Storage (www.storpool.com) is a leading global data storage software platform provider. Its solutions are recognized for their capabilities, high quality and expertise in accelerating applications and businesses. StorPool is the best block storage solution when building public and private clouds. StorPool's block-level, distributed storage software is designed from the ground up and is arguably the fastest and most efficient software-defined storage solution on the market today, replacing traditional SANs, all-flash arrays (AFA) or other less-efficient storage software products. With locations in Bulgaria, Switzerland and the United States, Storpool Storage was founded in 2011.

This is StorPool's first year as a member of the foundation, and it makes perfect sense for them to join us. Many of their customers rely on StorPool working flawlessly on AlmaLinux, and they know the importance of backing open source projects like AlmaLinux.

"AlmaLinux is helping companies around the world to run secure and efficient IT," said Boyan Ivanov, CEO at StorPool Storage. "it is a privilege to support them and work together."

## What's Next?

We'll have more sponsorship announcements coming this year with both new and returning sponsors. Those sponsorships will help us continue to meet the goals and needs of our community, and expand the number of ways and places we get to meet our users. If you've been on the fence about joining us as a sponsor member, feel free to <a href="mailto:benny@almalinux.org">reach out to me</a>! I'd love to help you decide where your engagement fits best.
