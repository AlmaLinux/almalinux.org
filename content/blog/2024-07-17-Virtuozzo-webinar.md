I'm excited to be joining an upcoming webinar with Virtuozzo, one of our newest Sponsor Members at the Foundation. I'll be talking about how and why folks use AlmaLinux and learning from Virtuozzo's Ihor Kolodiuk (Director of Cross-Platform Architecture) and Tetiana Fydorenchyk (Director of Global Product Marketing).

In my early days in the hosting industry, I was tasked with monitoring our fleet of servers often, and learning how to manage Virtuozzo instances was critical, so Virtuozzo has a special place in my heart.
