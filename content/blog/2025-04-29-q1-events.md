The first few months of 2025 were packed with some more big events for AlmaLinux! Learn a bit more about each of them below, and then find out how YOU can help staff AlmaLinux booths for events just like these for the rest of 2025!

### CentOS Connect

CentOS Connect is always a great place for us to connect with the CentOS Stream community.

While we were there, we hosted a [meetup about Project ELevate](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/centos-connect-2025/talk/TKT8TH/), which was great! We got to talk to people who were brand new to the project, and folks who hadd already used in it production.

Andrew Lukoshko presented on "AlmaLinux: the special derivative", which you can [view on YouTube here](https://t.co/8hcYuzkgJ3)! As part of that session, he announced that ELevate has added support for upgrading to CentOS Stream 10 in testing.

### FOSDEM

As we noted last year, FOSDEM is one of the most intense and rewarding events available for open source enthusiasts, and it's quickly become our favorite - even if it has a literal ton of people.

Saturday we got to have a booth, which is always a blast.

I helped organize and staff the [Distros Dev room](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/distributions/) on Sunday, and that was a blast!

On Sunday of the event, Andrew Lukoshko took the stage for his session ["From Manul to Kitten: 4 years of AlmaLinux development evolution."](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5472-from-manul-to-kitten-4-years-of-almalinux-development-evolution/)

Big shoutout to the folks who came through to the AlmaLinux booth to pick up their AlmaLinux swag and chat to us!

### FOSSASIA Summit 2025

We are always looking for more opportunities to get involved with our community in Asia, and FOSSASIA is a great chance to do just that! It's an event focused on the FOSS ecosystem - this year it took place in Bangkok, Thailand. I had to pull out of this event very last-minute. I was also grateful to Shunsuke Yoshida from our [Japanese User Group](https://almalinux.connpass.com/) for covering me, and to the Japanese Raspberry Pi Users Group and Cytron of Malaysia, for allowing us to borrow the Raspberry Pi 500 that we got to showcase there!

### SCaLE

This year marked the 22nd iteration of the Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE)! This continues to be one of our most beloved shows, just due to the fact that so much of the Linux community makes it out.

At the AlmaLinux booth, we showcased something very cool thanks to our friends at System76 and Ampere: the ["Fastest Arm PC"](https://t.co/RchCg8xJG8) running AlmaLinux OS Kitten!

I also spoke at SCaLE in a session called ["Choose your benefactor: Common good or Corporate good"](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/choose-your-benefactor-common-good-or-corporate-good). Thank you to the awesome group that came, we ended up with a really awesome conversation here that I hope they keep as part of the recording when it gets posted.

### CloudFest

CloudFest is the world's largest cloud industry event, and it was another exciting year for us there! At our booth, we chatted to a bunch of folks about the cool stuff we've been doing with AlmaLinux, joining the Foundation, and more. We gave away almost as many stickers at this one as we give away every year at FOSDEM... almost.

I gave had two sessions at CloudFest. The first one - called ["AlmaLinux: Choosing stability over drama every time"](https://www.cloudfest.com/agenda#/talk?id=74760) - was all about AlmaLinux in the webhosting space. The second - called ["Showing up - Your responsibility for keeping open source free"](https://www.cloudfest.com/agenda#/talk?id=75525) - was more of a roundtable, or birds of a feather, session. WE had a lively, spirited conversation about how to approach supporting open source for the long term, and the ways that individuals can have the most impact. Thank you to everyone who showed up to participate!
