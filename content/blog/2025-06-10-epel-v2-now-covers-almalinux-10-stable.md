In March, [ALESCo approved a proposal](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/blob/master/rfcs/0001-build-fedora-epel-for-almalinux-and-almalinux-kitten-x86_64_v2.md) to build EPEL packages from Fedoraâ€™s source RPMs (SRPMs) to maintain long-term feature parity for our x86_64_v2 support initiative. [Last month these packages became available for AlmaLinux Kitten 10](https://almalinux.org/blog/2025-05-13-epel-10-kitten-v2/), and today we are happy to announce **x86_64_v2 EPEL support is now available for AlmaLinux 10 Stable** as well.

The EPEL package builds for AlmaLinux OS 10 stable are now complete and ready for use!

## How It Works

We monitor the [EPEL repository](https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/10/Everything/source/tree/) for the latest stable packages, grab their SRPMs, and rebuild them using the [AlmaLinux Build System](https://build.almalinux.org/). These rebuilt packages are signed with a dedicated GPG key and then released to a [dedicated repository](https://epel.repo.almalinux.org). 

We also ensured that our EPEL packages have the `.alma_altarch` suffix for easy identification. 

## How To Use

EPEL support on x86_64_v2 works just like it [does](https://wiki.almalinux.org/repos/Extras.html#epel) on any other AlmaLinux system:

```
dnf install epel-release
```

Run the command in the terminal and you are good to go! 

## How To Report Bugs

If the RPM you're using has the `.alma_altarch` suffix and you face a bug, please, report it on the [AlmaLinux Bug Tracker](https://bugs.almalinux.org/). However, if the bug is reproducible on a non-_v2 system, using upstream EPEL, then the bug can be [reported to the EPEL packager](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#Where_can_I_find_help_or_report_issues?) like normal.
