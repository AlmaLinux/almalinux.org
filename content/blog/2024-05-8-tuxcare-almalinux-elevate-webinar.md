## Webinar highlights

- How to use the ELevate tool to migrate and/or upgrade your enterprise Linux deployments to a new distribution, including AlmaLinux, CentOS Stream, Oracle Linux, and others
- Why many organizations are opting to migrate their CentOS 6 and 7 systems to AlmaLinux as a community-owned, forever-free replacement distribution
- How organizations can level up their AlmaLinux experience with affordable commercial support that delivers premium enterprise-grade services

## Webinar Summary

With the end of life (EOL) of CentOS 7 less than two months away, many organizations are turning to the AlmaLinux OS Project's ELevate tool to enable a smooth transition to other RHEL-based distributions.

Join us on May 15th to see everything that this migration and upgrade tool has to offer. You'll also learn how to secure long-term, affordable commercial support for your enterprise Linux deployments after your ELevate-assisted transition is complete.
