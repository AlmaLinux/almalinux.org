Last December we hosted the very first [AlmaLinux Day in Tokyo](https://almalinux.org/aldt-2023/). As a user-focused event that brought together our community from all over Japan, this wildly successful event focused on the needs and desires of the open source community in Japan. We had nearly 100 attendees and 7 speakers from different industries. 

## The Talks

We had 7 presentations throughout the day, either presented in English with real-time translation to Japanese, or in Japanese. The videos are all on YouTube, but I also describe them a bit below. 

### AlmaLinux: Built to Last 
<em>benny Vasquez - Chair @ AlmaLinux OS Foundation</em><br />
language: english with translations to Japanese

We kicked off the day with me presenting a bit about how AlmaLinux got started and what we’ve been up to since then, to make sure that everyone attending had the same base understanding to start with.

Igor Seletskiy followed me and took us through the history of enterprise linux starting all the way back in 1993, and discussed the love that he has for the enterprise linux ecosystem.

## Up Next: AlmaLinux Day: Germany

If you missed us at AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo, I have good news! We're working on another event in Germany in March, and one in Raleigh, North Carolina in October! While the details for October are still being nailed down, I am excited to announce that [AlmaLinux Day: Germany](/almalinux-day-germany-2024/) will be March 18th, and will be adjacent to one of our favorite events: CloudFest.

The schedule includes speakers from the AlmaLinux community, and will cover everything from VFX to HPC to people using AlmaLinux as an upstream provider -- from all over the world. The first bit of information can be found on the AlmaLinux Day: Germany page.

### CloudFest: the intro

In case you aren't already familiar with CloudFest, this is their description: 

> The world’s largest cloud industry event is ready to once again take over a spectacular European amusement park to facilitate new partnerships, deep knowledge sharing, and the best parties the industry has ever seen. We do this because we love technology, we love people, and we’re excited for the possibilities that emerge when brilliant human beings connect.
