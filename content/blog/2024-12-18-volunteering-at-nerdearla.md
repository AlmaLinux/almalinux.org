This year Buenos Aires became a center of the IT technical community in Latin America with an event which became a beacon for technical enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, students and professionals - [Nerdearla](https://nerdear.la/en/), and I was honored to volunteer in this event - presenting AlmaLinux to a crowd that turned out to be massive, diverse, and passionate about open-source technology.

It can be quite interesting to tell you why I eventually decided to become a volunteer at this event. I have a great passion for technology, and a love of the open-source community. I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and cooperation especially between a diverse group of people. AlmaLinux, being a community-driven open-source project, resonates with me deeply, and I wanted to find a way to contribute in any way I could! Even before I got to Nerdearla, I felt the incredible excitement of the intelligent minds coming together to do something new in a creative way, which eventually appears to be a highly-demanded product. And as a newcomer to Argentina, I was tempted to join a new event as well.

Why did I choose to volunteer, you might ask? I have a deep-rooted passion for technology, and a love of the open-source community. I believe in the power of collaboration, especially between a diverse group of people. AlmaLinux, being a community-driven open-source project, resonates with me deeply, and I wanted to find a way to contribute in any way I could! Even before I got to Nerdearla, the magic of brilliant minds coming together to create and innovate was tangible. And as a newcomer to Argentina, I was incredibly excited to join a new event.

Attending the event Nerdearla for me was about being connected to the community shaping the whole technical industry. Simply saying, it wasn’t just about presenting Almalinux but more. And I must say that the energy of the event was palpable, and every attendee and volunteer could feel the infectious enthusiasm there.

Volunteering at Nerdearla was more than just an opportunity to give back to the tech community. It was a chance for me to practice my Spanish language skills, to learn from the amazing attendees, to grow my circle of friends in open source, and to be part of something bigger. For me personally it was a wonderful opportunity to input into the open-source technology no matter how small it was.

Looking back on the experience at Nerdearla I had, the feeling of accomplishment and pride comes up to my head. I can surely say that I am proud to be a part of the community and to present Almalinux, and I am happy to be able to participate at the event. And thank you for Almalinux and Nerdearla for giving me a chance to make a small contribution to the open-source community.

## I’ll be back - and you can come, too!

My experience at Nerdearla was also boosty for my personal growth, and it gave me a lot of joy for being part of the community, and I can’t wait for the next year to come to be able to do this all over again! I definitely plan to continue my journey in the world of open-source technology, and I can't wait to see what the future will bring.
