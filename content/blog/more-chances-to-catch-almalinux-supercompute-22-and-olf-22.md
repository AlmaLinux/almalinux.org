## All Things Open '22 was AMAZING

We had a chance to attend All Things Open last week, and it was an absolute blast for us! In case you haven't heard, All Things Open is a conference specifically designed around education and aimed at coming together to learn some of the hardest and deepest lessons in tech. It's just full of everyone from college students to CIOs and CTOs trying to make the best decisions for their futures. Meeting so many new people is always a blast, but the highlight for us is the people who are using AlmaLinux to solve their problems every day.

One of the best conversations I got to have was a group of folks from a university who are using AlmaLinux in a INCREDIBLE experiment that will absolutely drive future waves of innovation around how we interact with the universe. They said they were going to share details about it soon, and I can't wait to share those with all of you, as well.

In the meantime, though, for anyone that is joining us from ATO I just want to say: welcome. We're glad you're here, glad you're part of our community, and can't wait to see what you come up with! 

## Where are we next?

In case you missed it, we're confirmed to be going to 2 more events this year! Here's a quick list:

### [SC '22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/), Dallas, Texas

Next week we're joining the fine folks at SuperComputing for a second year in a row! We have seen a huge interest in folks using AlmaLinux for all kinds of interesting things, especially since we announced that you can use [AlmaLinux on Azure HPC](/blog/almalinux-for-azure-hpc-now-available/), and are being used by [4 of the top 500 SuperComputers](/blog/almalinux-and-the-top-500-hpc-supercomputers/). We also just posted about [how we built for the s390 platform!](/blog/how-we-built-almalinux-86-for-s390x/)

### [OLF](https://olfconference.org/) '22, Columbus, Ohio

The Ohio Linux Fest is one of the best linux-centric conferences in the country. We'll be back this year, and we're joining a panel with other distributions to discuss all of the current excitement on Friday. Come say hi!\ If you're in the area, make sure to stop by! If you know of a great event we're missing, [let us know](mailto:hello@almalinux.org). And if you're interested in volunteering to help staff a booth, let us know in the #marketing room on chat.almalinux.org. The Marketing SIG is always looking for volunteers!
