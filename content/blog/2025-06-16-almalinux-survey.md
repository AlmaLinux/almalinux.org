Open Source is incredible and powerful - anyone can just download your project and use it anywhere for any reason - without having to set up a business relationship with you!

But, without telemetry, that also means that anyone can use your project anywhere, for any reason, and you won't know anything about it until they send you an email, or find you at a conference to tell you about it...

To help AlmaLinux be able to make some data-based decisions without implementing telemetry, we're asking our users to [fill out this survey](https://survey.survicate.com/aa905da173921b82/?p=anonymous). It shouldn't take anyone more than 5 minutes, and will help drive the AlmaLinux project for a long time. 

## 5 minutes to help AlmaLinux

Help us understand how you use AlmaLinux and what support you need. Completing this survey allows us to:

- Learn how AlmaLinux is being used right now
- Focus on what our users need
- Improve documentation & support

Your feedback shapes the future: <https://survey.survicate.com/aa905da173921b82/?p=anonymous>

We're using Survicate to collect answers, but the collection is done completely anonymously, which you can read about on their blog: <https://survicate.com/blog/anonymous-survey/>

If you have any questions or feedback on the survey itself, feel free to reach out to our Marketing SIG in the [marketing room](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/marketing) on [chat.almalinux.org](http://chat.almalinux.org).

## Come hang out!
