After a year and a half, the time has finally come! The first election for the AlmaLinux OS Foundation board of directors is set to take place in September this year. This is a big moment for us and for the community at large, so we want to be as transparent and forthcoming as possible.

Let's take a look at where we're at right now.

## Now is the time

When we started the AlmaLinux OS Foundation we didn't have members to vote into a board, and so all current board members were appointed. Though necessary at the start of any such organization, it is ultimately counter to our goal of ensuring that the folks who are invested in the future of AlmaLinux are the ones to choose the future of AlmaLinux. Our bylaws were setup to include regular elections from the start, to ensure we could achieve the goal of all community members having a voice.

This is a good time to mention: if you care about the future of AlmaLinux, now is your time to join the AlmaLinux OS Foundation! The Membership Committee will meet for the last time before the election on August 18th. Anyone who's interested in voting this time needs to [apply for membership](/members/) before August 17th to have a vote this year!

## The Plan

We have outlined the entire plan for this [election on our wiki](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Election2022.html), but here are answers to the questions that I expect to get asked the most:

An election committee was appointed at the last board meeting made up of community members and a board member who is not standing for election.
Any person who has been a member in good standing for at least three months by the time the election starts is eligible to be nominated for a seat on the Board of Directors.
The election starts on Sept 4th, 2022, and will run until at least Sept 19th, 2022. If we don't reach quorum by Sept 19th, the election will stay open until quorum is reached.
A big list of questions and answers can be found [in the wiki](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Election2022.html). If you have any questions outside of that, you can reach out directly to the [Election Committee](mailto:election2022@almalinux.org), or find us in the election channel of our [Mattermost](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/foundation-election-2022)! This is your last chance! Get your [membership application submitted](/members/) before August 17th to have a vote this year!
