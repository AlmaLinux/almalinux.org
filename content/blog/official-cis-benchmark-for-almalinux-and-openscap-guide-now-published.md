Hello Community. Security minded people rejoice! Today, we are pleased to announce that the [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/) CIS Benchmark for AlmaLinux OS has been published and is now available.

For those less familiar, what are [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/) you ask? CIS Benchmarks are known best methods for the secure configuration of a target system that are both developed and accepted by the government, business, industry, and academia. You can use a CIS-made tool, [CIS-CAT](https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-cat-lite), to run and audit and compare the systemâ€™s configuration to the benchmark and generate a report that contains all the potential issues with the security.

You can also get started auditing systems immediately. Since the CIS Benchmark is already available for AlmaLinux 8.4 and 8.5 beta, you can run the profile using the very popular OpenSCAP tool. The OpenSCAP tool is used for automated vulnerability checking, which you can run via terminal or use the graphical OpenSCAP Workbench app. We've also published an [AlmaLinux OpenSCAP Guide](https://wiki.almalinux.org/documentation/openscap-guide.html) on the AlmaLinux Wiki that describes how to get started with both methods. Make sure to check that out.
