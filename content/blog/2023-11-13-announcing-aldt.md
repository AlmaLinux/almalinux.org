While the [Core SIG](https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/Core.html) and [Infrastructure SIG](https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/Infrastructure.html) have been hard at work bringing us [AlmaLinux 9.3](/blog/2023-11-13-announcing-93-stable/) (and prepping [AlmaLinux 8.9](https://almalinux.org/blog/2023-11-02-announcing-89-beta/) for next week), the [Marketing SIG](https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/Marketing.html) has been working on another exciting announcement: an event focused entirely on AlmaLinux. Already in? [Reserve your spot at AlmaLinux Day Tokyo now!](/aldt-2023/) 

Announcing AlmaLinux Day Tokyo
==============================

AlmaLinux Day Tokyo on December 9th, is an exciting event dedicated to all things AlmaLinux! Our team will be at the beautiful Internet Initiative, along with 150 new friends to talk about the current state and future of AlmaLinux. Alongside me, you can expect special apparencies by Igor Seletskiy, the man who got us started, and Yohei Suzuki from Cybertrust Japan, discussing the status of the industry and all the things we're excited to share.

AlmaLinux Day Tokyo is also scheduled just a few days after [Open Source Summit Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/), making it easy for anyone already attending OSSJ to join us for AlmaLinux Day, too! 

The Schedule
------------

Opening talks begin at 13:00 local time, along with several others who have had an active hand in contributing to the success of AlmaLinux. We have amazing things to share!

See the full schedule with all of its updates on the [AlmaLinux Day Tokyo 2023](/aldt-2023/) page, and make sure to register to save your seat!

Can't make it?
--------------

That's OK! All the talks will be recorded and posted to [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@almalinux6891). Keep an eye on our channel after the event! We will also be announcing two more events in 2024, so keep an eye out for an event near you!

Tokyo is an amazing city, and I am so grateful to Cybertrust Japan and all of our users in Japan for welcoming us. Can't wait to see you all there!
