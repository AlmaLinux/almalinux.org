We are returning to ATO, one of our favorite events, next week! And on day 2 if you wear an AlmaLinux shirt, hoodie, or hat then you are eligible to win a prize (details below)!

# We love ATO!

All Things Open is one of our favorite events, and always feels like home for us. It was the first event we attended after getting our feet under us in 2021, and the community continues to welcome us every year.

I'll be giving a talk and participating in a panel, and I'd love to see you at either or both! 

* 11:30 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 
	* The State of AlmaLinux: <https://2024.allthingsopen.org/sessions/the-state-of-almalinux>

* 2:45 to 3:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, Freedom vs Sustainable: A Candid Necessary Debate: <https://2024.allthingsopen.org/sessions/freedom-vs-sustainable-a-candid-necessary-debate>


## T-shirt giveaway (and a raffle!)

This year, we're doing something we've never done before (thanks to an increase in sponsorship this year!) and giving away t-shirts at our booth!

We've also decided to have a little fun with it, and on day 2 (Tuesday) of ATO at 12:30pm at the AlmaLinux booth (#88, right outside Ballroom A) we'll be doing a raffle! To be eligible to win you must:

-   Be present (sorry, no holds!)
-   Be wearing an AlmaLinux shirt, hoodie, or hat
-   Have the winning raffle ticket

If you don't have a shirt, that's okay! Remember: we're giving them away this year! We're only bringing about 800 shirts, which is less than half the people ATO expects to attend, so stop by early!

To accommodate the raffle, we will pause giving away shirts from 12pm - 1pm, or after the raffle concludes, to keep the madness down. :D

## Raffle prizes, you say?

We've got something for almost everyone....
