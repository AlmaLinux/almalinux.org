Today, we are glad to announce the availability of [AlmaLinux OS on the Azure marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/almalinux.almalinux-x86_64?tab=Overview). Images are available for both Gen1 and Gen2 and are deployable from the Azure portal, Azure command line utility as well as from the marketplace link.

Aside from just images, we've also established a worldwide [mirror network](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/) within Azure regions in order to make the user experience when installing updates or new software second to none. All updates and/or software installations will automatically use local Azure mirrors, thanks to our [new mirror service released a little while ago](/blog/the-new-and-improved-almalinux-mirror-service/). The best part is, its all transparent to you, the user.

We would sincerely like to thank the amazing Linux team at Azure for their sponsorship of AlmaLinux. Their sponsorship of the project and collaboration will enable many great things and you will be hearing more news real soon. The Azure team were instrumental to making this a success and collaborating with them upstream was a great highlight of this journey.

We're doing lots of great work and we hope you'll join us as we continue on our journey of bringing the community the ONLY 100% community owned and governed enterprise-grade Linux distribution and CentOS alternative. Please join us on the [AlmaLinux Community Chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/) and the [SIG/Cloud](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sigcloud) channel for any help and assistance.
