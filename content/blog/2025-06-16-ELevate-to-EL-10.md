Hello everyone! We are excited to announce the availability of new ELevate paths:
* AlmaLinux OS 9 to AlmaLinux OS 10.0.
* AlmaLinux OS 9 to AlmaLinux OS Kitten 10.
* CentOS Stream 9 to CentOS Stream 10.

### 3rd Party Repositories Support 

The new upgrades include the following 3rd parties repositories support: 
* EPEL - available for upgrades to AlmaLinux OS only. Note, that the support works only for those packages from EL 9 that are currently available for EL 10. Unavailable packages from EL 9 will remain on the system after the upgrade.
* Docker CE
* PostgreSQL

If there are additional third-party repositories youâ€™d like to see supported, we welcome community contributions - [ELevate Contribute Guide](https://wiki.almalinux.org/elevate/Contribution-guide.html).
