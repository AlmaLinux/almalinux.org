Andrew will be covering [ELevate](/elevate) and how to upgrade EL7 servers to EL8. ELevate is an open source project that provides the ability to migrate between major versions of RHEL-based distributions. It combines Red Hat's Leapp framework with a community created library and service for the migration metadata set required for it. Easily go from CentOS 7.x to any 8.x of your choice.

In this session Andrew will show how you can extend ELevate to:

Extend ELevate to include 3rd party repositories Upgrade 3rd party RPMs as part of ELevate upgrade Handle complex upgrades, where there is no 1:1 mapping between RPMs for EL7 and EL8

This live webinar will be hosted on August 4, 2022 | 9 AM PT | 12 PM ET, [Register today](https://go.oracle.com/LP=128968?elqCampaignId=354247)!
