We are so happy to share that the Japanese AlmaLinux Users Group is hosting the second [AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo](https://almalinux.org/aldt-2024/) this Saturday! Registration is free for attendance, and you can join the closing social event for a small fee.

## Announcing AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo 2024

This year's AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo will take place on December 14th. I will be at Cafe Shiba - WORLD SPACE, along with some old and new friends to talk about some of the best AlmaLinux Enterprise use cases and some of our ongoing and future initiatives. Alongside me, you can expect special appearances by some foundation members, some AlmaLinux user group members, and other industry experts! There will be valuable networking opportunities as well as an opportunity for attendees to share their own story in a "lightning talk" at the social gathering.

## The Schedule

Opening talks begin at 1:00pm local time, with some awesome content in store from members of the user group!

## Can't make it?

That's OK! Just like our previous events, the talks will be recorded and posted to our YouTube channel after the event. Keep an eye on our channel after the event! We will also be announcing more events in 2025, so keep an eye out for an event near you!

Just 12 months ago we hosted the first [AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo](https://almalinux.org/aldt-2023/). It was our very first official AlmaLinux OS Foundation event! As a user-focused event that brought together our community from all over Japan, this wildly successful event focused on the needs and desires of the open source community in Japan. We had nearly 100 attendees and 7 speakers from different industries. We also hosted [AlmaLinux Day: Germany](https://almalinux.org/almalinux-day-germany-2024/) in March of this year right next to CloudFest in Rust. You can check out the sessions on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@almalinux6891/playlists) if you missed these events!

Tokyo is an amazing city, and I am so grateful to Cybertrust Japan and all of our users in Japan for welcoming us. Can't wait to see you all there!
