## Preamble
I remember back in March when I went to [CloudFest](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-03-26-almalinux-march-events-roundup/) I was so excited to meet benny Vasquez, the chair of AlmaLinux OS Foundation, and when I got the chance to speak to her she gave me a lot of inspiration to contribute to AlmaLinux in any way I can.

First thing I did when I got back home was open an account in the [AlmaLinux chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/town-square) and the [AlmaLinux Forums](https://almalinux.discourse.group/) to start engaging with the community.

While translating the website to Hebrew was not on the top of my list it certainly was in mind, as a system administrator in a web-hosting company I can appreciate a good distribution when I see one, and so far I've been loving AlmaLinux OS!

Most of our servers are using AlmaLinux OS and I can recall that a lot web-hosting companies in Israel are using it as well, this made me feel compelled to translate the website to Hebrew and make it more appealing for Hebrew-speaking users.

## My experience
First of all I want to thank Cody Robertson for helping with [adding RTL support](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues/498) to the website when it lacked it! The experience I've had while talking to fellow contributors was nothing but amazing, with fast response and care taken for you I was astonished how can a foundation run so smoothly and reliably.

Translating the website was very straightforward. After creating an account in Weblate and heading to the [AlmaLinux Foundation project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/almalinux/) I just needed to translate random sentences or words from English to Hebrew and all the hard work is done by Weblate and the industrious approvers.

I encourage anyone to start and contribute to the AlmaLinux Foundation in any way they can, especially with translating the website to make it more accessible. It takes little-to-no linux knowledge to contribute in that way.

benny asked me to write a [documentation on how to help translate the website](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Help-translating-site.html), I was very comforted by the fact she asked ME out of everyone else to do so! Naturally, I agreed to do so, and I hope this helps!

If you have any questions about translations, [come ask them in the ~www room](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/www) on the AlmaLinux Mattermost chat!
