## 8.3? Pah! Old news. Say "Hello" to the newest distro on the block. AlmaLinux OS 8.4 Beta for all your testing needs. Now with Secure Boot goodness baked right in. This Is The Future The Future Is Here GIF - ThisIsTheFuture TheFutureIsHere YouAreLookingAtTheFuture GIFsBeta Release

Following the tremendously successful release of the [8.3 Stable release](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/x86_64/8.3.html) on March 30th the AlmaLinux Community is proud to announce the availability of [AlmaLinux OS 8.4 Beta](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/x86_64/8.4-beta.html). Now we know everyone is all excited and all, we are too, but we do need to remind everyone that this is a **BETA** release and should not be used for production installations. The provided upgrade instructions should not be used on production machines, unless you don't mind if something breaks. Now if you wanna test this somehow, somewhere to see how things will work in 8.4 stable, you're on the right track.

## Release Notes and More Information

You can read more about it by checking out the [Release Notes](https://wiki.almalinux.org/release-notes/8.4-beta.html). The biggest change you'll notice is that the #1 most requested feature, Secure Boot, is now fully supported in this release. Other changes include some new modules streams and some compiler updates. You can also find a link to the upstream release notes there, which will provide you with a complete list of changes and updates to this release.
