WWWW YEAAAAHHHH!!! We're back at it again! Two releases in a week? "You must be crazy," they said. Yup. We are. Crazy about the community and crazy about ARM. Aren't you glad you ducked out of work early today?

## Beta Release

The AlmaLinux OS Foundation is proud to announce [AlmaLinux OS 8.4 Beta for ARM](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.4-beta/isos/aarch64/). We know you must be super stoked, and we are too, but we do need to remind everyone that this is a **BETA** release and should not be used for production installations. Grab it up, test it out, submit your [Bug Reports](https://bugs.almalinux.org/) and [join the community](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sigaltarch) to talk all about it.

## Release Notes and More Information

You can read more about it by checking out the [Release Notes](https://wiki.almalinux.org/release-notes/8.4-beta-arm.html). Since this is the first beta release for ARM that's pretty much it for now. Let's test!
