AlmaLinux OS Foundation is happy to announce that EPEL support is now available on the **x86_64_v2** architecture for AlmaLinux Kitten 10!

Many users rely on Fedora EPEL for extra tools and packages, and we know that AlmaLinux users want access to Fedora EPEL packages on every architecture that AlmaLinux supports. Fedora EPEL doesn't cover x86_64_v2,  since Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL don’t build for this architecture. [ALESCo decided](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/blob/master/rfcs/0001-build-fedora-epel-for-almalinux-and-almalinux-kitten-x86_64_v2.md) to build EPEL packages from Fedora’s source RPMs (SRPMs) to make x86_64_v2 just as functional and useful as any other AlmaLinux Kitten 10 architecture.

## Will it be available for AlmaLinux 10?

Yes! As soon as 10.0 Stable is released, we'll work on providing the EPEL packages support for x86_64_v2 as well. Meanwhile, you can help us by telling how that works for you on AlmaLinux Kitten 10. 

## How It Works

We regularly check [EPEL repo](https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/10/Everything/source/tree/) for the latest stable packages, grab their SRPMs, and rebuild them using the [AlmaLinux Build System](https://build.almalinux.org/). These rebuilt packages are signed with a dedicated GPG key and then released to a [dedicated repository](https://epel.repo.almalinux.org). They also have the `.alma_altarch` postfix for easy identification.

## How To Use

EPEL support on x86_64_v2 works just like it [does](https://wiki.almalinux.org/repos/Extras.html#epel) on any AlmaLinux:

```
dnf install epel-release
```

Just run the command in the terminal and you are all set!
