Last October, when we announced [AlmaLinux OS Kitten](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-10-22-introducing-almalinux-os-kitten/), we also announced that we would be providing support for x86_64_v2 chips for the AlmaLinux OS 10 lifecycle. 

We know that many users of AlmaLinux rely on [Fedora EPEL](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/) for tools and packages outside the base set of packages included in AlmaLinux OS releases. Historically, our users have been able to rely on the Fedora project entirely for those packages. However, EPEL builds against RHEL, and with RHEL 10 moving to support only x86_64_v3, EPEL will no longer cover x86_64_v2 use-cases for version 10. 

In March, [ALESCo adopted a proposal](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/blob/master/rfcs/0001-build-fedora-epel-for-almalinux-and-almalinux-kitten-x86_64_v2.md) to build EPEL packages from Fedoraâ€™s source RPMs (SRPMs) to ensure long-term feature parity for our x86_64_v2 support.

We are happy to share that the build of EPEL packages for AlmaLinux OS Kitten 10 is now complete and ready for use!

## Will it be available for AlmaLinux OS 10?

Yes! As soon as 10.0 Stable is released, we'll work on providing the EPEL packages support for x86_64_v2 as well. Meanwhile, you can help us by telling how that works for you on AlmaLinux Kitten 10. 

## How It Works

We regularly check [EPEL repo](https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/10/Everything/source/tree/) for the latest stable packages, grab their SRPMs, and rebuild them using the [AlmaLinux Build System](https://build.almalinux.org/). These rebuilt packages are signed with a dedicated GPG key and then released to a [dedicated repository](https://epel.repo.almalinux.org). 

We also ensured that our EPEL packages have the `.alma_altarch` suffix for easy identification. That means that if the RPM you're using has the `.alma_altarch` suffix, you should likely be coming to AlmaLinux to report bugs. However, if he bug is reproducible on a non-_v2 system, using upstream EPEL, then the bug can be [reported to the EPEL packager](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#Where_can_I_find_help_or_report_issues?) like normal. 


## How To Use

EPEL support on x86_64_v2 works just like it [does](https://wiki.almalinux.org/repos/Extras.html#epel) on any other AlmaLinux system:

```
dnf install epel-release
```

Just run the command in the terminal and you are all set!
