Earlier today [we announced](https://www.einpresswire.com/article/752045731/almalinux-os-foundation-announces-continued-platinum-level-support-from-cloudlinux-and-tuxcare) that CloudLinux and its sister company TuxCare have renewed their platinum-level sponsorship of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation. They are continuing the commitment they made in 2021 of providing $1 million in annual support for AlmaLinux. I want to take a minute to thank them for the support they provide.

## Thank you

CloudLinux and Tuxcare were the reason we got off the ground, as founding sponsors. They have remained as platinum sponsors since the beginning, and are active contributors to AlmaLinux, and for the Linux and open source communities in general.

In the 42 months since [AlmaLinux first released](/blog/almalinux-os-stable-release-is-live/), we have done incredible things with the support of fanatics from across the world, but especially at CloudLinux and Tuxcare. Whether it's helping us staff events, helping recruit sponsors for the Foundation, letting their staff devote some of their time to working on the AlmaLinux day-to-day needs, or sponsoring folks like me to work full time on the project for more than a year now (especially such at a pivotal time as last year was), their support has been instrumental to the success of AlmaLinux.

Three thanks I'd like to give out specifically:

-   Thank you to the CloudLinux and Tuxcare employees who spend extra time on top of their jobs to support the AlmaLinux project, and who work to improve everything we do.
-   Thank you to the leadership team at CloudLinux and Tuxcare who continue to offer the use of their teams to help with things like graphic design (I am NOT a designer. :D), content creation, and so much more.Â 
-   And a special thank you to Igor specifically. He believed in the vision of a community-owned, and community-managed foundation to take the project forward, and made it happen. It's been two years since he stepped down from the board and [I was elected as Chair](/blog/hi-im-benny-how-can-i-help/). As he continues to step further back to allow more folks to take on responsibility, it's been incredible to see his support remains with equal enthusiasm.

## What's Next?

We'll be at a slew of events still this year, and I'd love to meet you! We'll also continue to highlight new and returning sponsors. These sponsorships allow us to continue to meet the needs of our community and expand the number of ways and places we get to meet our users. If you've been on the fence about [joining us as a sponsor](/members/), feel free to email me! I'd love to help you decide if sponsorship is the right move for your company.
