# AlmaLinux 8.6 Beta is now available

Hello World! We proudly present to you AlmaLinux 8.6 Beta "Sky Tiger" for [x86_64](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/x86_64/8.6-beta.html), [ARM](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/aarch64/8.6-beta.html) and [ppc64le](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/ppc64le/8.6-beta.html) architectures.

Installation ISOs are available on [mirrors](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/) now. Cloud and container images are in progress, so stay tuned for these in the next few days.

As usual, a simple reminder, this is a **BETA** release. It should not be used for production installations. The provided upgrade instructions should not be used on production machines unless you don't mind if something breaks. Now if you wanna test this somehow, somewhere to see how things will work in 8.6 stable, you're on the right track.
