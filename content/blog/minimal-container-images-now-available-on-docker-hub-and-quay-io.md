Hello All,

We've had a number of requests for minimal container images and we are glad to announce that those are now available on:

- Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/_/almalinux
- Quay.io: https://quay.io/repository/almalinuxorg/almalinux

**Minimal Image**

The minimal image is a stripped-down image that uses the microdnf package manager and contains a very limited package set. It is designed for applications that come with their own dependencies bundled (e.g. NodeJS, Python). The almalinux:minimal tag always points to the most recent version of the minimal image. Tags for major (e.g. almalinux:8-minimal) and minor (e.g. almalinux:8.4-minimal) releases are also available.

**Platform Image**

The default (platform) image is a general-purpose image with a full DNF stack and basic tools like find, tar, vi, etc. The almalinux:latest tag will always point to the latest stable release of the default image. Major releases and minor releases are also tagged with their version (e.g. almalinux:8 or almalinux:8.4).
