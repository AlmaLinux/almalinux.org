The [Top500 Supercomputers](https://top500.org/) list released for the [June 2022](https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2022/06/) update came out a short while ago and some community members spotted a familiar name on the list--**AlmaLinux**! CentOS was such a large part of the HPC community and AlmaLinux is continuing that tradition. We've been working closely with many in the HPC space including software and hardware vendors, super computer operators and researchers to make sure things continue to run smoothly for those in the HPC space looking for their next steps and providing a drop-in replacement.

We'd like to give a special thank you to our friends at [MEGWARE](https://www.megware.com/en) for their support on these deployments.

AlmaLinux is proud to be powering scientific research all over the world. It is part of the mission we set out to accomplish, not merely an OS--a community and platform for building the future **together**.
