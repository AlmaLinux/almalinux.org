    title: "A quick update on AlmaLinux OS Foundation membership applications"

Hello to all of you amazing folks invested in the success of AlmaLinux!

I wanted to provide you with a bit of an update around memberships, the membership plans, and the membership committee.

Since we opened the [membership application process](https://almalinux.org/blog/what-almalinux-foundation-membership-means-for-you/) for the AlmaLinux OS Foundation almost two weeks ago we've already had 76 people and organizations apply to be members at one of the membership levels. At the October meeting of the Board of Directors we also approved the plans for the governance of the membership committee, which we'll be adding to the [website shortly](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues/21).

The first meeting of the Membership Committee is scheduled for October 26th, and we'll be meeting for 30 minutes every other week thereafter. The goal is to review the applications as much as possible before the meeting so we'll be able to start quickly getting applications approved and getting memberships out the door.

If you have any questions, feedback, or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to [me](mailto:benny@almalinux.org), or to the full [membership committee](mailto:membership@almalinux.org)!
