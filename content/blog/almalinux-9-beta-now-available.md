Hello, Community! AlmaLinux OS is proud to announce [AlmaLinux OS 9.0 Beta](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos.html) for all 4 architectures: [x86_64](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/x86_64/9.0-beta.html), [aarch64](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/aarch64/9.0-beta.html), [ppc64le](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/ppc64le/9.0-beta.html) and [s390x](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos/s390x/9.0-beta.html), achieving architecture parity with upstream.

As this is a **BETA** release it should not be used for production installations. The provided upgrade instructions should not be used on production machines unless you don't mind if something breaks. Now if you wanna test this somehow, somewhere to see how things will work in 9.0 stable, you're on the right track.

## Cloud Images and Containers

Cloud images and containers are in process and we anticipate the first batch to be ready in 1-2 days.

## Release Notes and More Information

AlmaLinux OS 9.0 Beta is based on upstream kernel version 5.14 and contains enhancements around cloud and container development and improvements to the web console. This release also delivers enhancements for security and compliance including additional security profiles. Other various updates include Python 3.9, GCC 11 with the latest versions of LLVM, Rust and Go to make modernizing the applications faster and easier.
