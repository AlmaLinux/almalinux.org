The first round of accepted talks for AlmaLinux Day: Vancouver have been announced, and we are excited to welcome these talks and speakers! 

This year's event is shaping up quite nicely, and we are excited to welcome speakers from across industries and across the world! Find the full list of sessions below, check out all of the plans for the day [on the event page](https://almalinux.org/almalinux-day-vancouver-2025/), and [register for free](https://events.almalinux.org/event/135/) to attend this one-of-a-kind day in a beautiful city. 

If you have questions or would like to volunteer to help staff this year's event, we're looking for folks to help with registration and setup, as well as a couple people to help with tear down. Just email us at aldv@almalinux.org!
