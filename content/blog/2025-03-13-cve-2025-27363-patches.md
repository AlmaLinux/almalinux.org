_UPDATE March 17th, 2025 - these patches have now been released to production for AlmaLinux users._


## The Announcement

On Monday [Meta announced](https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2025-27363) a flaw in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below that can allow remote code execution.

From the announcement: 
> An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below (newer versions of FreeType are not vulnerable) when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files. The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild.

# Impact and Mitigation:

The vulnerability is devious and highly-enough rated that we are pulling in the patches for testing ahead of our upstream. These patches have been tested, but require further testing before we will release them to production. To help us out, please install the testing repo and then the updated packages and please share the results as soon as you can, either in [AlmaLinux chat](https://chat.almalinux.org), on [bugs.almalinux.org](https://bugs.almalinux.org), or by emailing [packager@almalinux.org](packager@almalinux.org).


## Installing the testing repo on AlmaLinux

It only takes a few steps to install and test the patched version of OpenSSH in the testing repo. 

**Install the testing repo**

```bash
dnf install -y almalinux-release-testing
``` 

**Then update the package:**

```bash
dnf update freetype
``` 

**Confirm you have the patched version of the package** 

The patched RPM versions are listed further down in this article.

```bash
rpm -qa freetype
``` 

Note: We don't recommend that you keep the testing repo enabled after you've updated the package, unless you've done this on a truly non-production environment. If this is a production environment, you can disable the repo with this command:


```bash
dnf config-manager --disable almalinux-testing
```

If you encounter problems, please let us know as soon as you can, either in [AlmaLinux chat](https://chat.almalinux.org), on [bugs.almalinux.org](https://bugs.almalinux.org), or by emailing [packager@almalinux.org](packager@almalinux.org).

## AlmaLinux OS 8 & AlmaLinux OS  9

Both AlmaLinux 8 and AlmaLinux 9 are vulnerable to this CVE. [Patches are not yet available from Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2025-27363), so the [patch we are pulling in](https://git.almalinux.org/jonathan/freetype/src/commit/dbe419ab4f282424ccf4b01c6bf5df4b7aa45d50/SOURCES/freetype-2.10.4-cve-2025-27363.patch) was written by Marc Deslauriers of Canonical and [shared on the Openwall oss-security mailing list](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/14/3).  It was adjusted and vetted by a member of the Meta security team.

We'd also like to thank Michel Lind of Meta for the initial backporting work in his [PR to CentOS Stream 9](https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/freetype/-/merge_requests/8) as well as for bringing this vulnerability to our attention.

#### Vulnerability Status and Patched packages

- AlmaLinux 8 is patched in ```freetype-2.9.1-9.el8.alma.1``` and above
- AlmaLinux 9 is patched in ```freetype-2.10.4-9.el9.alma.2``` and above

## AlmaLinux OS Kitten 10

AlmaLinux OS Kitten is not vulnerable to this CVE.
