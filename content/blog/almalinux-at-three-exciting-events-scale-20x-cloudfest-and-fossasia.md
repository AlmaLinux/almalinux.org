We're hitting the road again this year, and have three big events lined up in the next two months! If you're already a member of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation, stop by our booth and pick up your pin!

## SCaLE in California, Mar 9 - 12

[SCaLE](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x) is the largest community-run open-source and free software conference in North America, and is one of our absolute favorite events to attend! This year, SCaLE will take place this week from March 9th to 12th in Pasadena, CA. They have an amazing program of everything from training to traditional talks, and a huge expo hall. We will have a booth at the expo floor where you can learn more about the project, meet me, and get involved in the community!

## CloudFest in Germany, Mar 21 - 23

[CloudFest](https://www.cloudfest.com/) is a global cloud computing and hosting conference that brings together industry leaders, developers, and entrepreneurs to share knowledge and insights on the latest trends and innovations in cloud computing, with a focus on cloud and webhosting. AlmaLinux will have a booth (#R31) [on the expo floor](https://www.cloudfest.com/floor-plan), where you can meet me, another member of our community team, and see a delicious 128 Core ARM server from one of our partners, [Ampere](https://amperecomputing.com/).

## FOSSASIA Summit in Singapore, Apr 13 - 15

[FOSSASIA Summit](https://eventyay.com/e/7cfe0771) is an annual conference held in Singapore that aims to promote free and open-source software, as well as support the growth of the tech community in Asia. We get to join this year as an exhibitor, and I'll be speaking on open source both from a community and a business perspective.

### Open Source for Common Good or Corporate Good

The adoption of open source software is on the rise across all industries, but the definition of what 'open source' means is getting muddier and muddier. In this talk you will get a crash course in the differences and similarities in open source depending on who's funding the project, the different ways you can engage with the types of projects, and how to decide what time of project you want to work on.

The rest of the conference features talks, workshops, and exhibitions from various fields, including software development, hardware engineering, and data science. The AlmaLinux team is proud to support FOSSASIA and encourages anyone interested in open source to join us at this exciting event.

## Want us at your event?

As a volunteer-based project, AlmaLinux relies on the participation and contribution of developers, system administrators, and open-source enthusiasts from all over the world, and we are always excited to meet our community members at their favorite events! If you want us to join your event, join our [community chat](https://chat.almalinux.org) and let us know about it in the #marketing channel!

We hope to see you at SCaLE, CloudFest, or the FOSSASIA Summit,Â  and we look forward to welcoming you to the AlmaLinux community!
