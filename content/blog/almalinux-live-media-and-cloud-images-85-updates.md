Hey Community, just wanted to share some quick news on updates to Live Media and cloud images. All Live media have been updated to 8.5 thanks to the great efforts on the parts of our community and our [Live Media SIG](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/siglivemedia).

All variants are now updated to AlmaLinux 8.5 including GNOME Mini, GNOME, KDE and XFCE.

You can now grab Live Media images from [repo.almalinux.org](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8/live/x86_64/).

Sources are up on GitHub with build scripts and the configuration and kickstart files needed to produce Live Media images: [github.com/AlmaLinux/sig-livemedia](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/sig-livemedia) just in case you'd like to tweak any of them to your liking.

Also, visit the AlmaLinux Wiki to know more about the [Live Media SIG](https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/LiveMedia) and check the [Live Media Guide](https://wiki.almalinux.org/LiveMedia.html) for information on how to write images.

## Big thanks to Bala!

AlmaLinux would like to express thanks and extend a big hand to our Cloud and Containers SIG and Live Media SIG community member [Bala Raman](https://github.com/srbala). His immeasurable contributions and on behalf of the community are just simply--awesome!

## Cloud Image and Container Updates

This also kind of happened under the radar already but we figured we should share this too. All AlmaLinux Cloud Images and container images are updated to 8.5, including:

- [AWS AMIs](https://wiki.almalinux.org/cloud/AWS.html)
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/almalinux)
- [Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/almalinux.almalinux)
- [Azure HPC](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/almalinux.almalinux-hpc?tab=Overview)
- [Vagrant Boxes](https://app.vagrantup.com/almalinux/boxes/8)
- [Generic Cloud](https://wiki.almalinux.org/cloud/Generic-cloud.html)
- [OpenNebula](https://wiki.almalinux.org/cloud/OpenNebula.html)

The AlmaLinux team and community members have been working hard on this since the release and are proud to provide these images to the community.

Cheers to everyone! 9 is right around the corner...
