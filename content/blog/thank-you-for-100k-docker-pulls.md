Thank you and Congratulations on 100K+ Docker Pulls!

Hey Community, we're here to say Thank You, **again**, as we've hit another monumental milestone earlier today-- 100K+ pulls of our [Docker Library Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/almalinux). Not so long ago we celebrated 50K+ Docker Pulls (check out this post on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlmaLinux/comments/p3vowj/thank_you_and_congrats_on_50k_docker_pulls/))

Thank **YOU** to our worldwide Community members, **YOUR** enormous contributions, efforts and support. **YOU** make doing this worth it every day. Thank you, you're best!
