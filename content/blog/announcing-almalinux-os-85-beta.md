Presenting the [AlmaLinux OS 8.5 Beta](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos.html), codenamed Arctic Sphynx, for the x86_64 and Arm architectures, now ready for testing!

We're excited about it too, but we have to remind you: this is a **BETA** release and should not be used for production installations. The provided upgrade instructions should not be used on production machines, unless you don't mind if something breaks. Now if you wanna test this somehow, somewhere to see how things will work in 8.5 stable, you're on the right track.

## Release Notes and More Information

You can read more about it by checking out the [Release Notes](https://wiki.almalinux.org/release-notes/8.5-beta). The AlmaLinux OS 8.5 Beta contains improvements to container management tools, several new module streams, enhancements and additions to [System Roles](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3050101), an enhanced Cockpit web console, support for OpenJDK 17, additional security features for personal access tokens, and network time security (NTS) for NTP.
