## Live Media Images - now including ARM! 

All Live Media images that include GNOME, GNOME-Mini, KDE, XFCE and MATE are updated to [AlmaLinux OS 9.5](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.5/live/) version. 

Starting from AlmaLinux OS 9.5 all supported Live Media options are also available for the [ARM64(AArch64)](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9/live/aarch64/).

## More options 

The following options have also been updated to the latest versions:
* Incus and LXC to [AlmaLinux 9.5](https://images.linuxcontainers.org/images/almalinux/9/).
* Raspberry Pi images to [AlmaLinux 9.5](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.5/raspberrypi/images/).
    *  Since AlmaLinux 9.5, images with GPT (GUID partition table) are available in addition to traditional MBR images. GPT supports larger disks over 2TB and allows up to 128 partitions, compared to MBR's limit of 4. However, booting from a GPT disk is not supported on Raspberry Pi 3. Select the appropriate image for your Raspberry Pi model.
* [Vagrant Boxes](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/almalinux) to [AlmaLinux 9.5](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/almalinux/9) 
    * Added `langpacks-en` package for the `en_US.UTF-8` locale support.
    * Added `cifs-utils`, `fs-utils` and `rsync` to provide all types of Vagrant synced folders.
    * Added `tcpdump` and `tuned` packages for network troubleshooting and optimizations.
    * You can find more details and provider-specific changes on the [Vagrant Boxes](https://wiki.almalinux.org/installation/vagrant-boxes.html) page.
