In just over two months we'll be returning to FOSDEM [again with a stand](https://fosstodon.org/@almalinux/109806681564344149), a [bunch of friends](https://social.linux.pizza/@benny/111468054707170805), and this time we get to help host the Distros Dev Room!Â 

## What is a Developer Room?

From the [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2024/news/2023-11-08-devrooms-announced):

> *Developer rooms are assigned to self-organising groups to work together on open source projects, to discuss topics relevant to a broader subset of the community, etc.*

The general idea is that a group of people get together to organize a mini-event inside the FOSDEM umbrella. The groups of folks submit a proposal to the FOSDEM organizers, and then recruit content and build a schedule for the room. Everyone involved is likely to be a volunteer, but the content is always extremely beneficial, and presented by leaders and experts on their topics.

## CFP is open until December 8th!

The distros dev room opened its CFP a couple of weeks ago, and we have been seeing some great ideas come in! If you'd like to join us, you can submit your talk for inclusion up to December 5th. If you're looking for ideas, we've got a list of potential topics on our [official CFP announcement](https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2023q4/003529.html), and you can always look at previous years for more ideas.

### Important Dates

* CFP closes: Tuesday, 5 December 2023
* Deadline for accepted speakers to confirm: Tuesday, 12 December 2023
* Final schedule announcement: Friday, 15 December 2023

## How to attend

FOSDEM is a free conference that requires no registration of any kind. You just show up on the days of the event, and then attend the talks that you want to attend. It is an extremely popular event, so the talks are also recorded and posted later on the FOSDEM website.\
When the schedule is live, you'll be able to find it on the [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/distributions/), so keep an eye out for updates!

## Help out with other events!

We're already finalizing next year's event plans, and we'd love to help you attend one of them! If you are interested in helping staff one of the events we're attending next year, reach out to the [Marketing SIG](https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/Marketing.html), or email [benny](mailto:benny@almalinux.org)!
