## Release Notes and More Information

AlmaLinux 9.6 Stable continues to enhance performance, development tools, and security. Updated module streams improve support for web applications, while new compiler versions bring optimizations for better performance. The release also delivers updates to elfutils, Valgrind, SystemTap, and PCP improving system debugging and performance monitoring. Networking improvements come with new versions of NetworkManager and iproute. Security updates include new SELinux-policy and SSSD versions. Containerization and virtualization are improved with updated podman, buildah, libvirt, and QEMU-KVM. Additionally, the new snpguest and snphost packages enhance virtualization capabilities.

AlmaLinux OS 9.6 also includes a tech-preview of KVM virtualization support for the IBM Power architecture. It has been unavailable upstream since version 9.0, but is fundamental for a number of AlmaLinux users. That list includes the [Oregon State University Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org/), who submitted the [RFC to the AlmaLinux Engineering Steering Committee](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/3) for consideration in February. 

You can read the full release notes for this version on the wiki: [AlmaLinux OS 9.6 Release Notes](https://wiki.almalinux.org/release-notes/9.6.html).
