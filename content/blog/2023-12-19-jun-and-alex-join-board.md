The 2023 election has concluded and I am elated to announce our two newest members: [吉田淳 (Jun Yoshida)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jun-yoshida-6b4b5a16/) and [Alejandro (Alex) Iribarren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iribarren/).

## 2023 Election Results

As [you'll recall](https://almalinux.org/blog/2023-09-14-election-2023/), we are expanding the board this year to include a greater variety of voices that are driving the future of AlmaLinux. Adding to the diversity of our leadership team, Jun and Alex bring entirely new sections of AlmaLinux OS users to the group, ensuring that our leadership continues to move the project forward with everyone in mind.

Jun Yoshida drives the development of MIRACLE LINUX and open source adoption at Cybertrust Japan.  Over the last 20 years, he has dedicated a significant portion of his career to Linux distribution development. He is particularly interested in promoting certification by ISVs and IHVs, and SBOM-related technologies. "I believe that this initiative will contribute to the expansion of AlmaLinux usage in both consumer and business use, and they will be one of valuable assets for AlmaLinux. Through these efforts, I aspire to contribute to the provision of a long-term, stable distribution to a wide community and user base. Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about fostering face-to-face community meetups in Japan and Asia, facilitating close interactions with regional users, and cultivating further growth and collaborative relationships. I appreciate the great opportunity to join as a board member of AlmaLinux OS Foundation, and I am grateful for the chance to be a part of this and look forward to making a positive impact on AlmaLinux's future."

His experience with managing a large and diverse user base and his insights into the High-Energy Physics community will help the AlmaLinux Foundation to meet the needs of the scientific community and contribute to the overall success of the project's mission.

## Thank you!

The members of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation continue to astonish me with their engagement, with us meeting quorum for the election well under the minimum length of the election. While this election didn't involve much contention, we still are emboldened by the participation of our members.\
