## A Very Special Thank You to the CentOS Project and Team

For the last almost 20 years the CentOS Project and the team behind it have served the community faithfully and provided us with a stable and free enterprise-grade operating system and community. As the sun sets for CentOS Linux and it reaches end-of-life, The AlmaLinux OS Foundation, team and community members would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the CentOS team for all they have done, and made possible, for almost two decades. We look forward to continue collaborating and engaging with the CentOS Stream process and encourage the greater EL community to do so too as the Community Enterprise Operating System continues its evolution.
