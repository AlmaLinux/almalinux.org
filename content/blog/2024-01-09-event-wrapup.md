The last quarter (plus the end of September) of 2024 was packed with big events for AlmaLinux, and we were so excited to join them all! Learn a bit more about each of them below, and then find out how YOU can help staff AlmaLinux booths for events just like these in 2025!

### NERDEARLA

[NERDEARLA](https://nerdear.la/en/) is an event by nerds, for nerds. We attended our first NERDEARLA in Buenos Aires in September last year, and we loved it! [Pavel shared his experience](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-12-18-volunteering-at-nerdearla/) of staffing the booth for AlmaLinux, and he and I got to get to know our new friend Luis.

Â I also gave a talk at this event! You can watch it below, if you'd like.

### All Things Open

[All Things Open (ATO)](https://allthingsopen.org/) is the largest open source/tech/web event on the U.S. east coast, and we had a blast there again this year!

While I was there, I spoke in [a panel session](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/sessions/freedom-vs-sustainable-a-candid-necessary-debate) with Paloma Oliveira, Jacob Greene, Emily Omier, and Chad Whitacre about the balance between freedom and sustainability within open source. I also had [a session dedicated to talking about AlmaLinux](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/sessions/the-state-of-almalinux), which you can [watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuNUUNQSriE)!

We also had a lot of fun at our booth! Thank you to everyone who came by to see us. In case you missed it, we gave away a bunch of t-shirts and gave away some really cool prizes to people who showed up to our booth in their AlmaLinux swag.

### openSUSE.Asia and OSS Summit Japan

The AlmaLinux user group in Japan has been busy this year as well, attending all kinds of events and even putting on AlmaLinux Day, Tokyo. They represented AlmaLinux at both openSUSE.Asia and OSSSummit Japan. You can see the talk from some of the members (who also work for one of our platinum sponsors: Cybertrust Japan) on the Linux Foundation youtube channel.

### SeaGL

[SeaGL](https://seagl.org/) is a grassroots technical summit dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about FOSS, hardware, and culture. Jonathan, our Infrastructure Lead, had great time meeting up with folks at our booth!

### SFSCON

The South Tyrol Free Software Conference, [SFSCON](https://www.sfscon.it/), is one of Europe's most established annual conferences on Free Software. We had a great time meeting up with everyone who joined us there in Italy. I also participated in not 1, not 2, but 3 talks/workshops! One was [all about AlmaLinux](https://www.sfscon.it/talks/almalinux-in-brief/), the second was about [how to build a drama-free community](https://www.sfscon.it/talks/building-a-no-drama-community/), and the last was a [BOF workshop](https://www.sfscon.it/workshops/almalinux-bof/). We also got to enjoy some AlmaLinux cupcakes from Kiki Bakery Lab. Thank you to everyone who attended my sessions and came to say hi!

### Ohio LinuxFest (OLF)

[OLF](https://olfconference.org/about/) is a smaller grassroots conference for the GNU/Linux/Open Source Software/Free Software community. Jonathan Wright, our Infrastructure Lead, had a great time meeting up with everyone who showed up to this event in Ohio!

{{< figure src="/blog-images/2025/olf_2024_booth.jpg" width="45%" title="" >}}

Jonathan gave a talk in which he discussed the evolution of Enterprise Linux in the last decade, the life of AlmaLinux in its first 3 years, and why we think freedom drives innovation.

### SC '24

[SC](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/) is an international conference for HPC, networking, storage, and analysis. We decided it was another great opportunity to spread the love with AlmaLinux swag, and some prizes! We gave away more than 800 t-shirts, and gave away more awesome prizes to folks who showed up to the booth in their swag.

While we were there, I also gave [a talk about welcoming diversity and disagreement in your open source project](https://sc24.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=exforum103&sess=sess696). Thank you to everyone who showed up to my session and to the booth!

### AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo

This year's AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo was entirely arranged by the [Japanese AlmaLinux Users Group](https://almalinux.connpass.com/). We will have pictures and videos of the talks to share from them soon!
