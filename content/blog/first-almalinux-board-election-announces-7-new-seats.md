Over a month ago I announced that we would be holding our [first board election](/blog/first-almalinux-os-foundation-election/). Our nearly 300 members of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation have spent the last two weeks casting their votes for the new board, and I am very happy to announce the newest board. These seven nominees have been elected by the community to serve a three-year term as the AlmaLinux OS Foundation board members.

**How the election worked**

The AlmaLinux bylaws were set up to include regular elections, to ensure AlmaLinux could achieve the goal of all foundation members having a voice.

- An election committee was appointed made up of community members and a board member who was not standing for election.
- Any person who had been a member in good standing for at least three months by the time the election started was eligible to be nominated for a seat on the Board of Directors.
- The election started on September 4, 2022, and could have run until at least September 19, 2022. If the minimum quorum of 50% membership participation had not been reached by September 19, the election would have stayed open until a quorum was reached.

It was especially exciting for me to see us reach our quorum easily within the first week of the election. Our engaged community is one of the things that proves the worth of AlmaLinux to the world.

**Meet the Board**

The board has a lot of familiar faces, and a few new ones to meet! This team brings together highly motivated and engaged experts from across industries. This is the group of humans that will help AlmaLinux OS reach its full potential over the next three years.
