To address some of the common community questions that we are getting, we are excited to share that we will be creating short Q&A videos that will be shared on some of our most common outreach platforms. You may have seen the first of these videos shared on our channels in November, which was a short conversation between Andrew and I.

## Want to get involved?

If you have any burning questions about AlmaLinux, let us know [on the forums](https://forums.almalinux.org/t/faq-q-a-video-questions/3445)! And if you are interested in sharing your AlmaLinux knowledge and want to flex your public speaking chops, we're looking for community members to feature in the Q&A videos. You can drop a message in the [~marketing](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/marketing) channel letting us know you're interested.

If you would like to be more active in the AlmaLinux community but this isn't the right fit, there are lots of other ways to get involved too!

-   Join our SIGs! You can read more about our special interest groups here: <https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/>

-   Join us at industry events! We attend lots of events throughout the year to talk to people about AlmaLinux. This can also be an opportunity to add to your resume as a speaker, as we sometimes have AlmaLinux community members participate as speakers at events. If you're interested in participating in events with us, let us know in the [~marketing](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/marketing) channel.

-   Want to help answer community questions, but don't want to be on camera? We greatly appreciate community members who help others, whether that be in [chat.almalinux.org](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/pl/5o5ffzjc53djtrifnuqdeb1ser), on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlmaLinux/), or otherwise.

2024 is going to be an amazing year in the enterprise linux ecosystem, and we are excited to have you along for it.
