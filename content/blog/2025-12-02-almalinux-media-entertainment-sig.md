The AlmaLinux community is thrilled to announce the formation of our newest Special Interest Group: the Media & Entertainment SIG!

This group is dedicated to supporting and enhancing the use of AlmaLinux within the professional visual effects (VFX), animation, and post-production industry. With recent changes, licensing and support costs are creating significant disruption in the M&E software ecosystem.The need for a stable, community-owned, enterprise-grade Linux platform has never been more urgent.

The Media & Entertainment SIG is here to bridge that gap.

### Our Mission: Ensuring Production-Ready Stability

Simply put, our core mission is to ensure AlmaLinux becomes the trusted, production-ready Linux platform for studios of all sizes.

We are establishing this SIG to serve as the central collaboration hub for artists, engineers, and open-source developers. The collective work of this group will directly address the unique requirements of a production pipeline, guaranteeing AlmaLinux is a seamless and reliable environment for creative work.

This is a focused effort, and we are diving straight into the deep end of the production world. We'll be working to certify and ensure compatibility with industry-standard applications like Nuke, Houdini, Maya, etc. At the same time, we will be building and documenting the reference builds and architecture studios need - from high-performance workstations to massive render farms and secure storage systems. The goal is a production pipeline that runs on rock-solid, community-driven enterprise Linux.

Excited and want to get involved? We're immediately looking for individuals with expertise in systems engineering, pipeline TD, packaging, or technical artistry to contribute to our SIG. Our focus areas include Packaging, Testing and Benchmarking, Documentation, and Upstream Collaboration. 

Join our efforts:
-   Meetings: First Wednesday of every month at 16:00 UTC (virtual).
-   Communication: [~sig-media-entertainment on chat.almalinux.org](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sig-media-entertainment) and [our mailing list](https://lists.almalinux.org/mailman3/lists/media-entertainment-sig.lists.almalinux.org/).

### What's Next on the Timeline?

The work starts now. Our immediate focus for Q1 2026 is documenting AlmaLinux workstation and render farm configurations. By mid-to-late 2026, we aim to publish official reference architectures and compatibility guidelines for M&E studios.

We are excited to work with you to make AlmaLinux the secure, stable, and high-performance platform the Media & Entertainment industry can build its future on.
