# AlmaLinux Day: Germany - Recap

This past March, we hosted AlmaLinux Day: Germany right next to CloudFest in Rust, Germany. Similar to [AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-02-01-aldt-recap/) in December 2023, AlmaLinux Day: Germany focused on the needs and desires of the AlmaLinux community. Sessions covered everything from VFX to HPC to people using AlmaLinux as an upstream provider -- from all over the world. We had nearly 300 attendees, we were elated to engage with our community in such a tangible way.

## The Talks

We heard from 11 speakers at AlmaLinux Day: Germany, covering all kinds of involvement in the project and what AlmaLinux's security and stability mean for them. All sessions are now available for viewing on YouTube, and short descriptions can be found below.

### <u>Building without following: RHEL compatibility for AlmaLinux's Community</u>

Finding our footing without using Red Hat Enterprise Linux has been an exciting venture, but the number one question we get is still "How do you build AlmaLinux?" In this presentation Andrew Lukoshko takes you through where AlmaLinux gets its code, how we confirm compatibility, and how we build.

#### Speaker: Andrew Lukoshko - Release Engineering Lead, AlmaLinux
