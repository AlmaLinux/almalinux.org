Hello Community! We're currently in the midst of rethinking our web presence and associated entities. Our site is our face to the world and is the primary source of information and resources for tens of thousands of visitors each month. As we continue to grow we want to make sure the site gets even better and more useful, informative, localized and accessible.

To that end, we would like to put out a call for ideas, improvements and also contributors. Our current stack is django and python and lives [here on github](https://github.com/almalinux/almalinux.org). We're not necessarily against moving to a different stack if anyone has a good idea and thinks they can pull it off.

Please let us know how we can help make the site more useful for you. If you're a web dev and would like to rock it with us on a site which reaches million of people a year then please reach out to us on The [AlmaLinux Community Chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/), the [AlmaLinux subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/almalinux) or [@almalinux on Twitter](https://twitter.com/almalinux).
