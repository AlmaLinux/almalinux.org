Next week, we'll be at the world's largest cloud industry event, [CloudFest](https://www.cloudfest.com/)! Here's a rundown of what we'll be up to at the event.

## What is CloudFest?

### CloudFest 2025: The Human Edge

CloudFest is the #1 internet infrastructure event in the world, connecting the global cloud computing industry: you’ll form the partnerships that help you reach your business goals, and have a great time doing it. CloudFest returns to deliver an even bigger, more engaging live event experience that will surprise longtime attendees and first-timers alike.

The world’s largest cloud industry event is ready to once again take over a spectacular European amusement park to facilitate new partnerships, deep knowledge sharing, and the best parties the industry has ever seen. We do this because we love technology, we love people, and we’re excited for the possibilities that emerge when brilliant human beings connect.

## Come by our booth

This year, we'll be at [booth Z24 in the Dome](https://www.cloudfest.com/floor-plan)! Make sure you stop by to chat about the cool stuff we've been doing with AlmaLinux, joining the Foundation, or any other questions! And while you're there, make sure you pick up AlmaLinux stickers for you and your employees.

## AlmaLinux speaking sessions

I'll be delivering two talks while I'm at CloudFest. If you're interested in attending, here are the details:

**[AlmaLinux: Choosing stability over drama every time](https://www.cloudfest.com/agenda#/talk?id=74760)**

The Ring Stage (Dome) <br />
Tue, Mar 18 @ 15:05 - 15:15 CET

AlmaLinux has been quietly serving the world with a rock-solid operating system, a welcoming community, and a non-profit focused on stability and longevity for the last four years. Come hear why we chose stability over drama, and how it serves you even if you never chose AlmaLinux.

**[Showing up - Your responsibility for keeping open source free](https://www.cloudfest.com/agenda#/talk?id=75525)**

Bar Camp - Tommi Ungerer <br />
Wed, Mar 19 @ 11:15 - 12:00 CET

Passionate contributors in open source can have equally engaging, but often opposing, approaches to the correct structure around an open source project. We have seen well-intentioned project leaders failing to fully surrender control of a project and strangle it. We have also seen projects be too lenient and allow themselves to be abused by a person or small group of people.

In either case, the community has to show up in force to help keep the projects that we all care about on the right path. Come be part of a discussion around how to engage in your favorite open source projects, how to support them best, and how to ensure we all continue to benefit through collaborative contributions. 

## Can't make it?

That's OK! The first session will be recorded and shared on the CloudFest YouTube channel after the event! There are also plenty of other opportunities to see us coming up:

-   April 25-27: Linuxfest NW
-   June 5-8: Flock to Fedora
-   June 12-14: DevConf
-   August 10-14: SIGGRAPH and Academy Open Source days
-   September 23-27: nerdearla
-   October 12-14: All Things Open
-   November 7-8: SFSCon
-   November 16-21: SC25

If you like chatting with folks about Linux and open source and are interested in helping us staff a booth at an event, [fill out this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cQ0YQiAcRZXPnDqiHak-AXmsjEBz-IQE8s8jbPLykds/edit)! We'll cover your travel and hotel for events that you attend on behalf of AlmaLinux.

If you see an event missing that you think we should attend, or if you know of any amazing open source events in Asia, South America, or Africa, let us know! Our community is growing quickly in those areas, and we'd love a chance to connect with them!
