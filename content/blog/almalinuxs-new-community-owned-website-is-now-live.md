There’s been a lot of progress since the AlmaLinux Beta release was announced back in January 2021. The AlmaLinux community has grown enormously, and we’ve established the AlmaLinux governance board. 

More and more partners and sponsors have joined our community. Consequently, we saw the demand for a clean and minimalistic website, localized in several languages, and with an easy-to-use interface.

So we’re excited to announce that, as of July 5th, 2021, the new-and-improved AlmaLinux website is live! 

The website is entirely open-source. It is MIT-licensed and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org). The AlmaLinux team have spent months working on the website to bring you the absolute best user experience. Contributions to the development of the AlmaLinux website were 100% community-driven. According to Matīss from AlmaLinux web presence team -

*“Working on the new AlmaLinux website alongside our community was an invaluable experience. The localization of the website was entirely crowd-sourced using the [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) platform. We want to extend a big shout-out to the team at Weblate for their sponsorship of the hosted localization platform and for their continued contributions to our community.”*

The updated website is available in eight languages and includes a modern design that is much more intuitive. It provides easier access to relevant community channels, forums, and content.

From everyone at AlmaLinux, we would like to say a big thank you to everyone who participated and contributed during the website development. We value your ongoing contributions to the AlmaLinux website project and the AlmaLinux community!
