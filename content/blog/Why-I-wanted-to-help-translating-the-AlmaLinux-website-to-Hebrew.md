## Preamble
I remember back in March when I went to [CloudFest](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-03-26-almalinux-march-events-roundup/) I was so excited to meet benny Vasquez, the chair of AlmaLinux OS Foundation, and when I got the chance to speak to her she gave me a lot of inspiration to contribute to AlmaLinux in any way I can.

First thing I did when I got back home was opening and account in the [AlmaLinux chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/town-square) and the [AlmaLinux Forums](https://almalinux.discourse.group/) to start engaging with the community.

While translating the website to Hebrew was not on the top of my list it certainly was in mind, as a system administrator in a web-hosting company I can appreciate a good distribution when I see one, and so far I've been loving AlmaLinux OS!

Most of our servers are using AlmaLinux OS and I can recall that a lot web-hosting companies in Israel are using it as well, this made me feel compelled to translate the website to Hebrew and make it more appealing for Hebrew-speaking users.

## My experience
First of all I want to thank Cody Robertson for helping with adding RTL support to the website when it lacked it :), the experience I've had while talking to other fellow contributors was nothing but amazing, with fast response and care taken for you I was astonished how can a foundation run so smoothly and reliably.

Translating the website was very straight forward, after creating an account in Weblate and heading to the [AlmaLinux Foundation project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/almalinux/) I just needed to translate random sentences or words from English to Hebrew and all the hard work is done by Weblate and the industrious members of the marketing SIG or another team leads.

I encourage anyone to start and contribute to the AlmaLinux Foundation in any way they can, especially with translating the website to make it more versatile with little to no knowledge needed to do it.

Benny asked me to write a [documentation on how to help translating the site](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Help-translating-site.html), I was very comfurted by the fact she asked ME out of everyone else to do so!, naturally I agreed to do so, I hope this helps!
