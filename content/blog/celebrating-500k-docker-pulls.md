Thank you to our amazing community and congratulations on [500K+ Docker Pulls](https://hub.docker.com/_/almalinux)! What a marvelous milestone!

It seems like just a short time ago, we celebrated 100K Docker pulls together (check out this post on Reddit). Now that we've hit 500K+ pulls of our [Docker Library Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/almalinux), we'd like to take this opportunity to thank you again. We're truly humbled by the support we've gotten from the community.

## The reward for loving containers is... more containers!

We have a whole raft of images available on Docker Hub and other registries as well. Here's a short list in case you'd like to check some of them out.

**[Default](https://wiki.almalinux.org/containers/docker-images.html#almalinux-default-platform)**: Is a general purpose (platform) container image that contains default packages and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the CentOS 8 image.

**[Minimal](https://wiki.almalinux.org/containers/docker-images.html#almalinux-minimal)**: A minimal, compacted image that contains a limited package set and uses the microdnf package manager. It is designed for applications that come with their dependencies bundled like GO, NodeJS, Java. Note: This image is also UBI-alternative.
