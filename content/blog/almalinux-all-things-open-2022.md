All Things Open 2022 is this week in Raleigh, North Carolina, and we're here all week! It's a great event that's focused on the tools, people, processes and technology that make open source possible.

All Things Open has been an epicenter of open source genesis for a years, and it's one of the best US conferences for us to meet our users and contributors face-to-face. Come see us on floor 4 of the convention center, right across from Ballroom C.
