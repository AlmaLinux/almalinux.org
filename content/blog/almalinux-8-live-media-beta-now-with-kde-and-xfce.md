Hey all! Time flies. Just last week we announced AlmaLinux Live Media beta images available in 2 options: [GNOME and GNOME Mini](/blog/announcing-almalinux-live-media-beta/).

Since then, community members have requested other desktop environments as well and so we’ve worked hard over the past few days to build [KDE](https://kde.org/) and [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/) Live Media Images and we are happy to announce those today.

You can now grab all of the Live Media images from: https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8/live/x86_64/

Here's the GitHub repository with build scripts and configuration files: https://github.com/AlmaLinux/sig-livemedia
