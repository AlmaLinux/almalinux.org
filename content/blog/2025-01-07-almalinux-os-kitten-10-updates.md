Back in October 2024 AlmaLinux OS Foundation officially [introduced](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-10-22-introducing-almalinux-os-kitten/) AlmaLinux OS Kitten 10. It is designed as a development-focused distribution of AlmaLinux OS, and a stable preview of AlmaLinux OS 10. Today we’re excited to share the latest updates in this project! 

## Updated packages and ISOs 

Recently, the CentOS Stream 10 undertook a significant mass package rebuild to update the cryptographic keys used for PowerPC (ppc64le) compilation. We have also rebuilt all packages to align with these critical changes. 

As promised, we have also released our quarterly ISO rebuilds! They are [available](https://kitten.repo.almalinux.org/10-kitten/isos/) for download today, and bring updates including Linux kernel 6.12 and updates to Qt packages, which make AlmaLinux OS Kitten 10 version compatible with the KDE desktop environment from the EPEL repo. 

## Cloud and Container Options

Another important update is that along with the standard ISO releases, AlmaLinux OS Kitten 10 now includes Cloud and Container images:
