We'd like to thank all of our community members for helping us reach a monumental milestone--50K+ pulls of our [Docker Library Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/almalinux). Including our old (non-official library) image we now have over 70K pulls!

This wouldn't have been possible without the tremendous support and contributions of community members from around the world--and for that we thank you!

Interested in containers? Looking for something you need? Wanna contribute? Join our [Containers and Cloud SIG](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sigcloud) on the AlmaLinux Community Chat. We're waiting for you.
