Hey, community! AlmaLinux Day: Vancouver is coming up fast---August 9th at the beautiful Emily Carr University of Art + Design---and we're putting together what promises to be our most exciting event yet!¬†

With speakers from across the VFX industry, hands-on workshops, and a whole lot of Linux love, this is going to be a day to remember.

But here's the thing: we need YOUR help to make it happen!

Volunteering Helps the Community
--------------------------------

AlmaLinux has always been about community. We're a community-owned operating system, powered by people who care about open source and want to see it thrive. Our events are no different---they're built by volunteers, for the community.

Where We Need Your Superpowers
------------------------------

We've got several areas where we could really use some helping hands:

### The Night Before: Swag Prep Party üéÅ

Friday evening, August 8th, we'll be stuffing tote bags with all the goodies attendees will receive. Think of it as a low-key hangout session where we prep for the big day---perfect if you want to meet other volunteers and get pumped for Saturday!

### Check-In Desk üìã

Saturday morning, we need friendly faces to welcome attendees, hand out name badges, and help people find their way around. You'll be the first impression people get of AlmaLinux Day, so if you're outgoing and love meeting new people, this is perfect for you!

### Setup Crew üîß

Help us transform the Reliance Theatre into AlmaLinux central! We'll need hands to arrange seating, set up signage, prepare the registration area, and make sure everything looks awesome before doors open.

### Teardown Team üßπ

After all the awesome talks wrap up (and after cocktail hour!), we'll need help getting everything cleaned up and packed away. Many hands make light work, and we promise to make it fun!
