Hello everyone! Following our [recent updates about the ELevate project](https://almalinux.org/blog/2025-01-14-elevate-updates/) and your feedback, we’ve added one more upgrade path. You can now upgrade from CentOS Stream 9 to CentOS Stream 10 as a part of ELevate NG!

**Please note: This upgrade is currently for testing purposes only and is not intended for production environments.**

## Get Testing

We’d love for you all to help us test the upgrades to CentOS Stream 10 and share your feedback. Early testing allows us to identify and address potential issues and ensure a smoother upgrade for users.

Testing instructions are similar to the previously announced upgrade to AlmaLinux 10.0 Beta and can be found [here](https://wiki.almalinux.org/elevate/ELevate-NG-testing-guide.html#upgrading-almalinux-9-to-almalinux-10). As defined in the wiki directions, **the only difference is the leapp-data package** that you use for the upgrade.

Please, report any bugs you may see to the [ELevate leapp repository](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/leapp-repository).

## Contribute and Get Help

We thank you for your continued support and contributions to the ELevate Project and AlmaLinux OS.

**Happy testing and stay tuned for more updates!**
