We've attended quite a few events in the US this summer! In June, we attended [Southeast LinuxFest](https://southeastlinuxfest.org/) in Charlotte, North Carolina. In July, we traveled to Denver, Colorado for [Academy Open Source Days](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-days/) and [SIGGRAPH](https://s2024.siggraph.org/) 2024\. This month, we went to Rochester, New York for [Flock to Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/flock/2024/). Let's talk about what we loved about each of them.Â 

## Southeast LinuxFest

[SouthEast LinuxFest](https://southeastlinuxfest.org/) is a community event for anyone who wants to learn more about Linux and Open Source Software. This relatively small event was a new one for me, and I'm so glad we went! I got to meet a couple of our contributors, have some really good conversations, and, even ensure that everyone there celebrated National Donut Day.

## Academy Open Source Days

[ASWF](https://www.aswf.io/) is a foundation that's part of the Linux Foundation, and this event allows them to focus on the projects that their community relies on to do the incredible work they do. We were invited to share a bit about the project overall, as many of the ASWF members have been switching to AlmaLinux for both their desktop environments and their render farms. As a one-day event, they saw record attendance, almost doubling their audience from last year!

## SIGGRAPH

SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques) is an annual conference and international community that focuses on computer graphics and interactive techniques.

The television and movie industries have embraced AlmaLinux as a solution to the end of CentOS Linux, and we are so excited to learn how they're using AlmaLinux. The [VFX Reference Platform](https://vfxplatform.com/) guides folks in the industry by making technology recommendations, and we are grateful to be part of that list! Tristan from [SHED, Inc](https://shedmtl.com/) brought his VFX industry expertise and we had a steady flow of people every day of the event!

## Flock to Fedora

Flock to Fedora is an annual conference for contributors to the Fedora Project, and as an upstream operating system for AlmaLinux and a place where much of the AlmaLinux community is active, we knew we had to support the event!

Our Infra team lead even gave his first live talk ever, covering the history of the mirror system and what they're up to next! The session can be found [here on the Fedora event site](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-2024/talk/RMUDAX/), but he also wrote a [companion blog post](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-08-07-mirrors-1-to-400/) to go align with it.
