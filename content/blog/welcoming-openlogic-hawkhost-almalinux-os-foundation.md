[Earlier today](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230320005256/en/AlmaLinux-OS-Foundation-Welcomes-OpenLogic-and-Hawk-Host-as-Newest-Sponsors) the AlmaLinux OS Foundation announced our two newest sponsors, [OpenLogic by Perforce](https://www.openlogic.com/) and [Hawk Host, Inc](https://www.hawkhost.com/).[ ](https://www.openlogic.com/)We are extremely excited to have them both join the foundation, but the most exciting thing is how this reflects on the strength of the AlmaLinux mission.

One of the things I specifically pointed out in the announcement is the support that OpenLogic provides users of AlmaLinux OS. The team they have built provides incredible end-to-end support for a plethora of open source packages, and having them present as a sponsor of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation proves that their enterprise customers see AlmaLinux as the stable RHEL clone that we know it to be.

Hawk Host provides some of the best and most stable web hosting in the business for customers across industries, and has been a long-time supporter of the AlmaLinux community. Hawk Host has made the partnership official with this sponsorship. When Cody started working more closely with the Infrastructure SIG last year before joining the board, it was obvious that Hawk Host customers were also choosing AlmaLinux often, and his use and support of the [ELevate project](https://almalinux.org/elevate/) was essential.

**What's Next?**

We'll have more sponsorship announcements coming throughout the year with both new and returning sponsors. Those sponsorships will help us continue to meet the goals and needs of our community, and expand the number of ways and places we get to meet our users. If you've been on the fence about joining us as a sponsor, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:benny@almalinux.org)! I'd love to help you decide if sponsorship is the right move.

In case you missed it, I [posted about a few events](https://almalinux.org/blog/almalinux-at-three-exciting-events-scale-20x-cloudfest-and-fossasia/) we have booths at! SCaLE was last week, but CloudFest is this week, and FOSSASIA is just under a month away! If you want to see us at an event anywhere in the world, feel free to drop in our chat and ping me!
