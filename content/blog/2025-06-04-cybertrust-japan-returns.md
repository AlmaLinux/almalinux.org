On the heels of one of our biggest releases ever, last week we announced that our friends at [Cybertrust Japan Co., Ltd](https://www.cybertrust.co.jp/english/) (a subsidiary of SB Technology Corp) have renewed their platinum sponsor membership for a third year.

Anticipating using AlmaLinux as the base for [MIRACLE LINUX](https://www.miraclelinux.com/), Cybertrust Japan approached us two years ago looking for a partner. They recognized the value that AlmaLinux provided to businesses, especially in Japan. They know firsthand the benefits that adopting open source software has for enterprise businesses, no matter the industry.

Cybertrust Japan's contributions to the project - both financial and code - will allow us to expand AlmaLinux OS's security and enterprise adoption. Cybertrust Japan's support is a clear catalyst for this, and we're so grateful!

In their second year as part of the foundation, their support was instrumental in standing up the second [AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo](https://almalinux.org/aldt-2024/) hosted by the[ AlmaLinux Japan Users Group](https://almalinux.connpass.com/), creating a channel - [User Group - Japan](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/user-group---japan) - for Japanese speakers to congregate on the AlmaLinux Community Chat, and in staffing the incredible [FOSSASIA](http://summit.fossasia.org) event in Bangkok.

## Continued expansion in Asia

We plan to participate in the [Open Source Summit in Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/) this December, expand user group participation, and participate in more open source conferences in Japan. We are also working with the Japan User Group to set up another AlmaLinux Day: Tokyo - currently targeting January 2026!

We'll also have more sponsorship announcements coming throughout the year that will include both new and returning sponsors. Those sponsorships will help us continue to meet the goals and needs of our community, and expand the number of ways and places we get to meet our users. If you've been on the fence about joining us as a sponsor, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:benny@almalinux.org)! I'd love to help you decide if sponsorship is the right move.
