If you are running an AlmaLinux OS 9 machine, you need to know about a [vulnerability in OpenSSH's server (sshd)](https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/01/3) in glibc-based Linux systems that was published earlier today, July 1, 2024. It has been assigned the identifier CVE-2024-6387 and named *regreSSHion*. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely and grants unauthenticated root access. 

Security is our top priority at AlmaLinux and we aim to deliver patches to our users as quickly as possible. The openssh patch for CVE-2024-6387 has been released and is available for AlmaLinux OS 9 users. The decision to build the update and push the package to production on our own (without a CentOS Stream/RHEL update) was made by our newly-formed technical steering committee, [ALESCo](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-05-21-introducing-alesco/).

We are committed to working upstream and have [submitted this patch to CentOS Stream 9](https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/openssh/-/merge_requests/77) to benefit the whole ecosystem.

Update the openssh package to protect your system against this issue:

```bash
sudo dnf --refresh upgrade openssh
```

Confirm the updated version. You are looking for **openssh-8.7p1-38.el9.alma.2**.

```bash
rpm -q openssh
```
