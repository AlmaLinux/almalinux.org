AlmaLinux OS 9 is impacted by a newly disclosed [vulnerability in OpenSSH's server (sshd)](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/08/2) in glibc-based Linux systems similiar to last week's [CVE-2024-6387](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-07-01-almalinux-9-cve-2024-6387/). The new vulnerability has been assigned the identifier **CVE-2024-6409**. It involves a signal handler race condition, which could expose your system to potential security risks. 

At AlmaLinux, we place security first and we are committed to delivering patches to our users as quickly as possible, especially when our community needs them. The decision to build the update and push the package to production without waiting for a CentOS Stream or RHEL update was made by our newly-formed technical steering committee, [ALESCo](https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-05-21-introducing-alesco/). 

The OpenSSH patch for CVE-2024-6409 has been released and is available for AlmaLinux OS 9 users. 

Update the OpenSSH package to protect your system against this issue:

```bash
sudo dnf --refresh upgrade openssh
```

Confirm the updated version has been installed. Our initial patch was included in **openssh-8.7p1-38.el9_4.1.alma.1**. After RHEL updated to include the upstream patch, we updated again to ensure we were 100% in line with RHEL. The package you're looking for is listed on the [CVE-2024-6409 errata page](https://errata.almalinux.org/9/ALSA-2024-4457.html)

```bash
rpm -q openssh
```
