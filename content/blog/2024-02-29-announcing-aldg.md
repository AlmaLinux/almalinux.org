In December, we hosted the first [AlmaLinux Day in Tokyo](/aldt-2023/). As a user-focused event that brought together our community from all over Japan, this wildly successful event focused on the needs and desires of the open source community in Japan. We had nearly 100 attendees and 7 speakers from different industries!

We're excited to build on that momentum with AlmaLinux Day: Germany, coming to Europa Park Rust on March 18th. 

# AlmaLinux Day: Germany 

As CentOS enters its final six months of support, everyone is wondering where to go next. The AlmaLinux community benefits from the stability and intentionality that we take to building a stable, free operating system. At AlmaLinux Day: Germany, we'll share what we do and how we're supporting our community.

This event happens after the [CloudFest Hackathon](https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/), so if you're in the area for that event, make sure to join us!

## The sessions

AlmaLinux Day: Germany will kick off with a keynote where we will talk about the amazing accomplishments we've seen over the first three years of our journey, and then some community members will join me on stage to share about the projects they're working.

Next, the AlmaLinux OS Architect and Release Engineering Lead, Andrew Lukoshko, will present a session focusing on how we make the most stable, secure, and predictable RHEL-compatible Linux distribution around.

It's also been a few years [since our last board AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS54wRKoUQk), so we thought we'd include one at ALDG. Some of the AlmaLinux board members will discuss a bit about their ideas for the future of AlmaLinux and about why they are involved, but I'd love to also be able to include questions from our community! If you have a question [add it to this thread on the forums](https://almalinux.discourse.group/t/almalinux-day-germany-board-panel-questions/3658), and I'll try to include as many as I can!

## Get some swag

Attendees who [register by March 1st](https://eventyay.com/e/c9789850) will get free swag (stickers, pens, keychains)! Registration is free, but seating is limited, so make sure to save your spot.
