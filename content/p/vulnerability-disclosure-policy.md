Do you think you've found a security flaw in AlmaLinux OS or one of our related projects? Read below for how to responsibly report it!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

> - [Our security.txt file](/security.txt).

Taking the time to report a security vulnerability to us is greatly appreciated, and we will use ever resource at our disposal to respect your time during the reporting process. When reporting an issue, please provide **as much information** as possible, but at least:

- The project and version (even better if you can identify the specific commit) where you identified the vulnerability
- A detailed description of the steps to reproduce 
- If appropriate, please include a proof of concept (plaintext only; no binaries)
- Please also include your recommended remediation(s), if any, or any other concerns.

> #### Do Not Send:
> - Sensitive or personal information.
> - Public disclosures of vulnerabilities.

Our maintainers will attempt to respond to and confirm your report within 2-3 days, but if you believe your report to be *critical* to user safety and security, please note as such in the subject. We are fortunate enough to have hundreds of thousands of systems relying on the expertise of the AlmaLinux OS Team, and we take security very seriously.

## Example Report

```text
- **Title**: Failed to start OSBuild Composer

- **Environment**: AlmaLinux 8, Platform: X86_64, OS Version: 8.5

- **Description**:
    I am unable to start the OS build composer. When I try to start the `osbuild-composer.service`, it stops immediately:

    [root@localhost ~]# systemctl status osbuild-composer.service
    ● osbuild-composer.service - OSBuild Composer
        Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/osbuild-composer.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
        Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Tue 2022-02-08 00:18:43 EST; 32min ago
        Process: 1657 ExecStart=/usr/libexec/osbuild-composer/osbuild-composer (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
        Main PID: 1657 (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)

    Feb 08 00:18:43 localhost.localdomain systemd[1]: osbuild-composer.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
    Feb 08 00:18:43 localhost.localdomain systemd[1]: osbuild-composer.service: Service RestartSec=100ms expired, scheduling restart.

    Feb 08 00:18:43 localhost.localdomain systemd[1]: Failed to start OSBuild Composer.

- **Steps to Reproduce**:
    1. Install AlmaLinux 8.4 and update to 8.5.
    2. Run `sudo dnf install osbuild-composer composer-cli cockpit-composer bash-completion`.
    3. Run `sudo systemctl enable --now osbuild-composer.socket`.
    4. Try running `composer-cli blueprint list` or start the image builder service in Cockpit.

- **Expected Result**: The OS build composer should start without issues.

- **Actual Result**: `osbuild-composer.service` stops immediately with an exit code error.

- **Severity**: Urgent
```

## Where to Report

- For issues that are directly related to the AlmaLinux operating system itself, please send your report to [bugs.almalinux.org](https://bugs.almalinux.org), this insures that your report is received by the right people.

- For **non OS-related** reports (.e.g Elevate, almalinxu.org website, etc), send your report to [security@almalinux.org](mailto:security@almalinux.org) directly so we can coordinate a responsible patch and release.

#### Report using GitHub issues
