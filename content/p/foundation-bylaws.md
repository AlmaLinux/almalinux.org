- If a Member is itself a consortium, membership organization, user group or other entity that has members or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such Member shall extend only to the paid representatives (employees and individuals serving on a contractor basis) of such Member, and not to its members or sponsors, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors in a specific case from time to time.

### Section 2.10 (Additional Classes of Members)

The conditions, privileges, powers, and voting rights (if any) of any class of Members may be changed, any class of Membership may be deleted, and one or more additional classes of Membership may be created, and the conditions, voting rights (if any), powers and privileges of each such class may be prescribed, by adoption of an amendment to these By-laws pursuant to Article XIV of the By-laws.

### Section 2.11 (Termination or Suspension of Membership)

Any Member may be suspended from Membership or have its Membership terminated by the Board of Directors for failure to satisfy its Membership Obligations or for engaging in any conduct, either within or without the Foundation, that is contrary to the interests of the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s business or industry goals (in either case, other than conduct or actions taken in good faith reliance on Section 13 of these By-laws). Financial Obligations already paid shall not be refundable upon any such termination or suspension, and all Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of the date of such termination shall remain due and payable. Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.11, no termination or suspension of Membership for any other purpose shall be effective unless:

- The Member is given notice of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership and of the reasons therefor;

- Such notice is delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a national or international overnight courier service, sent to the last address of the Member shown on the Foundation’s records;

- Such notice is given at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership; and

- Except in the case of a termination or suspension of Membership for failure to satisfy a Financial Obligation, such notice sets forth a procedure determined by the Board of Directors (or other body authorized by the Board of Directors) to decide whether or not the proposed termination or suspension shall take place, whereby the Member is given the opportunity to be heard by such body, either orally (and represented by counsel if the Member so desires, at its sole cost and expense) or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of theproposed termination or suspension.

### Section 2.12 (Resignation by Member)

### Section 2.14 (Levy of Dues, Assessments or Fees)

The Foundation may levy dues, assessments or fees upon its Members in such amounts as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors, but a Member upon learning of any increase in dues, or of any levy of any assessments or fees, may avoid liability therefor by resigning from Membership prior to the date such dues, assessments or fees are due and payable, except where the Member is, by contract with the Foundation or otherwise, independently and explicitly liable for such dues, assessments or fees. No provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Foundation authorizing such dues, assessments or fees shall, of itself, create such liability. In no event shall the failure of a Member to pay any dues or assessments give rise to any claim in favor of the Foundation for indirect or consequential damages.

### Section 2.15 (Use of Names)

Neither the Foundation nor any Member shall use the name of the other in any form of publicity without the written permission of the other, provided that the Foundation and any Member may each disclose and publicize such Member’s Membership in the Foundation.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Foundation has not made a filing under the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, as amended, a Member may request that its Membership not be disclosed if it makes a written request to such effect at the time of application to the Foundation for Membership.

### Section 3.2 (Annual Meeting)

Annual meetings of Members ordinarily shall be held by written consent pursuant to Section 3.10 or virtually pursuant to Section 3.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Board of Directors may call any annual meeting to be held in person at such date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or its Chair. Pursuant to such written consent, or at such meeting, as applicable, the Voting Members shall elect a Board of Directors in accordance with Section 4.3 and shall transact such other business as may properly be addressed by written consent, or at such meeting, as applicable.

### Section 3.3 (Special Meetings)

Special meetings of the Members, for any purpose or purposes, may, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, be called by the Board of Directors, the Chair or the Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Directors then in office, or at the request in writing of Voting Members entitled to vote at least ten percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting.

Upon request by any person or persons entitled to call a special meeting of the Voting Members, the Chair of the Board of Directors, any Vice-Chair or the Secretary shall, within thirty days after receipt of the request, cause notice to be given to the Voting Members entitled to vote at such meeting that a special meeting will be held at a time chosen by the Board of Directors, but not less than thirty-five nor more than ninety days after receipt of such request.

### Section 3.4 (Notice of Meetings)

Except as otherwise provided by law or these By-laws, notice of each meeting of the Members, annual or special, stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which Members may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, to each Member entitled to attend such meeting.

### Section 3.5 (Voting List)

The officer who has charge of the Membership Book of the Foundation shall prepare at least ten days before every meeting of Members, a complete list of the Members entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each such Member. Nothing contained in this Section shall require the Foundation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any Member, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting:

- on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or

- during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Foundation. In the event that the Foundation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Foundation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to Members of the Foundation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any Member who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any Member during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

### Section 3.6 (Quorum)

Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By- laws, a quorum at all meetings of the Members for the transaction of business shall be established when a minimum of ten percent of all Voting Members entitled to vote, where such Voting Members are entitled to vote a minimum of ten percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members (or such higher percentage of Voting Members as may be required by law, these By-laws or the Certificate of Incorporation to approve any action to be taken at such meeting), are present in person or represented by proxy. Member Committees shall have the same rules relating to quorum requirements and voting majorities as provided for in these By- laws, unless otherwise approved by the affirmative vote of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise proved by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws.

At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to all Members entitled to vote at the meeting

### Section 3.8 (Action at Meetings)

- When a quorum is present at any meeting of Members, the vote of more than fifty percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the question shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question;

- Notwithstanding Section 3.8(a), in the event that any vote is to be taken of a single class of Voting Members, then a quorum for such vote shall be not less than fifty percent of the Voting Members of that class, and when such quorum is present, the vote of more than fifty percent of the aggregate votes of the Voting Members of that class present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the question, shall decide such question.

### Section 3.9 (Proxies)

Each Member entitled to vote at a meeting of Members, or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for the Member by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a Member may authorize another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy pursuant to this Section, the following shall constitute valid means by which a Member may grant such authority:

- A Member may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the Member or such Member’s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

- A Member may authorize another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy by transmitting or authorizing an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the Member. If it is determined that such electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.

### Section 3.10 (Action Without Meeting)

Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of Members, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of a Member Committee, subcommittee thereof or other group of Members or subset of Members, may be taken without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, shall be signed by Members (or members of a class of Members, as the case may be) making up not less than that percentage of all Members as would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Members (or class of Members, as the case may be) entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those otherwise entitled to vote thereon who have not consented in writing.

An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a Member or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a Member or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written and signed for the purposes of this Section, provided that any such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Foundation can determine (A) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the Member or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the Member or proxyholder and (B) the date on which such Member or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission.

A consent given by electronic transmission is delivered to the Foundation upon the earliest of: (i) when the consent enters an information processing system, if any, designated by the Foundation for receiving consents, so long as the electronic transmission is in a form capable of being processed by that system and the Foundation is able to retrieve that electronic transmission; (ii) when a paper reproduction of the consent is delivered to the Foundation’s principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of Members are recorded; (iii) when a paper reproduction of the consent is delivered to the Foundation’s registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or (iv) when delivered in such other manner, if any, provided by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Foundation. A consent given by electronic transmission is delivered under this provision even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system establishes that a consent given by electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.

Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a document (including any electronic transmission) may be substituted or used in lieu of the original document for any and all purposes for which the original document could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original document.

### Section 3.11 (Action Held by Remote Communication)

If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, Members and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of Members may, by means of remote communication: (A) participate in a meeting of Members; and (B) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of Members whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that

- the Foundation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a Member or proxyholder,

- the Foundation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such Members and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the Members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and

- if any Member or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Foundation.

### Section 3.12 (Nomination and Election Procedures)

Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, the Board of Directors shall establish reasonable nomination and election procedures given the nature, size, and operations of the Foundation, including a reasonable means for Members of appropriate classes to nominate a person for election as a Director, a reasonable opportunity for a nominee to communicate to the Members the nominee’s qualifications and the reasons for the nominee’s candidacy (if requested by such nominee), a reasonable opportunity for all nominees to solicit votes (if requested by any such nominee), and a reasonable opportunity for all Members entitled to vote thereon to choose among the nominees.

### Section 3.13 (Order of Business)

The order of business at all meetings of Members shall be as determined by the presiding Officer, but the order of business to be followed at any meeting at which a quorum is present may be changed by a vote of the Voting Members.

## ARTICLE IV

Any or all of the Directors may be removed by a majority vote of such class of Members. Unless otherwise specified by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, any Director may be removed by a Supermajority of the other Directors then in office for engaging in any conduct, either within or without the Foundation, that is contrary to the interests of the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s business or industry goals.

### Section 4.6 (Vacancies)

A notice by electronic mail must include a prominent legend that the communication is an important notice regarding the Foundation.

- Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Members, but subject to subsection (e) of this Section, any notice to Members given by the Foundation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By-laws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the Members to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the Member by written notice or electronic transmission to the Foundation.

- Notice given pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section shall be deemed given: if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the Member has consented to receive notice; if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the Member or Director of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (3) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the Member or Director

- For purposes of these By-laws, (1) “electronic transmission” means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, including the use of, or participation in, or one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases), that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process, (2) “electronic mail” means an electronic transmission directed to a unique electronic mail address (which electronic mail shall be deemed to include any files attached thereto and any information hyperlinked to a website if such electronic mail includes the contact information of an officer or agent of the Foundation who is available to assist with accessing such files and information) and (3) “electronic mail address” means a destination, commonly expressed as a string of characters, consisting of a unique user name or mailbox (commonly referred to as the “local part” of the address) and a reference to an internet domain (commonly referred to as the “domain part” of the address), whether or not displayed, to which electronic mail can be sent or delivered.

### Section 8.5 (Advance Payment)

The Foundation shall convert any records so kept into clearly legible paper form upon the request of any person entitled to inspect such records pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. When records are kept in such manner, a clearly legible paper form prepared from or by means of the information storage device, method or one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases) shall be valid and admissible in evidence, and accepted for all other purposes, to the same extent as an original paper record of the same information would have been, provided the paper form accurately portrays the record.

### Section 12.5 (Document Form, Signature and Delivery)

Without limiting the manner in which any act or transaction may be documented, or the manner in which a document may be signed or delivered:

- Any act or transaction contemplated or governed by the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws may be provided for in a document, and an electronic transmission shall be deemed the equivalent of a written document. “Document” means (i) any tangible medium on which information is inscribed, and includes handwritten, typed, printed or similar instruments, and copies of such instruments and (ii) an electronic transmission.

- Whenever the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws requires or permits a signature, the signature may be a manual, facsimile, conformed or electronic signature. “Electronic signature” means an electronic symbol or process that is attached to, or logically associated with, a document and executed or adopted by a person with an intent to authenticate or adopt the document.

- Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and recipient, an electronic transmission shall be deemed delivered to a person for purposes of the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws when it enters an information processing system that the person has designated for the purpose of receiving electronic transmissions of the type delivered, so long as the electronic transmission is in a form capable of being processed by that system and such person is able to retrieve the electronic transmission. An electronic transmission is delivered under this Section even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgement from an information processing system establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.

This provision shall not prohibit one or more persons from conducting a transaction in accordance with any electronic signature rules so long as the part or parts of the transaction that are governed by the DGCL are documented, signed and delivered in accordance with this Section or otherwise in accordance with the DGCL. This Section shall apply solely for purposes of determining whether an act or transaction has been documented, and the document has been signed and delivered, in accordance with the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws.
