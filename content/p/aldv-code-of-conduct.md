The AlmaLinux community values openness, respect, and inclusivity. We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form in our community. All communication and behavior, both online and in-person, should be appropriate for a professional audience that includes people of many different backgrounds and levels of experience.

## Reporting Issues

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please immediately report the situation to a conference organizer. The appropriate people will be clearly identified and trained to handle such situations respectfully and confidentially.

You can report issues via email during or after the event at: conduct@almalinux.org

All reports will be handled with discretion. We take all reports seriously and are committed to addressing them as promptly as possible.
